</div>

<p class="no-indent">For two Greek boys have I made this little
book, which tells them in English some of
the stories that they soon will read for themselves
in the tongue of their forefathers.</p>

<p>But the stories are not only for boys
whose fatherland lies near the sunny sea
through which ships, red-prowed and black,
fared in the long-ago days.</p>

<p>Of such great deeds, by such brave men,
do they tell, that they must make the hearts
of all English boys, and of boys of every
nation under the sun, grow big within them.</p>

<p>And when, in the gallant-sounding music
of the Greek tongue in which the tales first
were told, these boys read the story of the
Siege of Troy, they must surely long to fight
as fought the Greeks in days of old, and long
to be heroes such as those who fought and
who died without fear for the land that
they loved.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF WHAT LED TO<br />
THE SIEGE OF TROY</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the deep forest that clothes Mount Ida,
not far from the strong city of Troy, Paris,
son of King Priam, watched his father’s
flocks by night.</p>

<p>Suddenly through the dim woods he saw
a light, as if the golden sun and silver moon
shone both together.</p>

<p>And, lo! in the radiance of this light there
stood before him the three fairest of the
goddesses&mdash;queenly Hera, wise Athene, and
lovely Aphrodite.</p>

<p>Like music stealing through the trees
came the soft voice of Hera:</p>

<p>‘Of all mortal men art thou the most
beautiful, Paris, and to thee do we come
for judgment. Tell us which of us is the
fairest of all, and to that one whom thou so
deemest, give this golden apple.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>So spake Hera, and placed in the hand of
Paris an apple of purest gold.</p>

<p>Again she spake: ‘If to me, Hera, queen
of goddesses, and wife of mighty Zeus, king
of all the gods, thou dost grant the prize
of loveliness, Power immeasurable shall be
thine. King shalt thou be of the lands
where the grey dawn rises, and king even
to where the red sun goes down. A hundred
peoples shall call thee lord.’</p>

<p>She was silent, and the voice of Athene,
fair and pure as a silver moonbeam, broke
the stillness of the starless night.</p>

<p>‘To me award the prize,’ she said, ‘and
wise as the gods shalt thou be. With me
as thy friend and guide, all things will
be possible to thee.’</p>

<p>Last of all, standing in a rosy light, as of
the dawning sunlight in the spring, spoke
Aphrodite.</p>

<p>‘What are Power and Wisdom, fair Paris?’
she pled. ‘Wisdom and Power bring no
joy at last. I will give thee Love, and for
thy wife thou shalt have the fairest woman
in all the world.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>And Paris, the melody of her voice still in
his ears, as he gazed spellbound on her face
of wondrous beauty, handed to Aphrodite
the golden prize.</p>

<p>So was it that the wrath of the gods came
upon Paris, son of Priam. For Hera and
Athene, filled with rage, vowed to be revenged
upon Paris and all his race, and
made all the gods pledge themselves to aid
them in their vengeance.</p>

<p>Across far seas sailed Paris, with Aphrodite
as his guide, to Sparta, where Menelaus
was king.</p>

<p>A brave king was Menelaus, and happily
he lived in his kingdom with Helen, his
queen, fairest of all women. One child they
had, a little maid, Hermione.</p>

<p>When to Sparta there came Paris, with
eyes blue as the sea, and hair that gleamed
like gold on his purple robe, gallant and
brave, and more beautiful than any mortal
man, glad was the welcome that he had
from Menelaus.</p>

<p>And when Paris gazed on Helen’s face,
he knew that in all the world there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>no woman half so fair as the wife of
Menelaus.</p>

<p>Then did Aphrodite cast her magic upon
Helen.</p>

<p>No longer did she love her husband, nor
did she remember little Hermione, her own
dear child.</p>

<p>When Paris spoke to her words of love,
and begged her to flee with him, and to be
his wife, she knew only that she loved Paris
more than all else. Gladly she went with
him, and in his red-prowed ship together
they sailed across the green waves to Troyland,
where Mount Ida showed her snowy
crown high above the forests.</p>

<p>An angry man was Menelaus when he
found that Paris had stolen from him the
fair wife who was to him as his own heart.</p>

<p>To his elder brother Agamemnon, overlord
of all the Greeks, he went and told his
grievous tale.</p>

<p>And from far and wide did the Greek hosts
gather, until a hundred thousand men and
eleven hundred fourscore and six ships
were ready to cross the seas to Troyland.</p>

<p class="p2">Many were the heroes who sailed away
from Greece to punish Paris and his kin,
and to bring back fair Helen to her own
land.</p>

<p>Few there were who came home, for ten
long years of woe and of spilling of blood
came to the men of Greece and of Troy from
the fatal beauty of Helen the queen.</p>

<span class="reduce">HOW ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON<br />
FELL OUT</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">Before the walls of Troy the Greeks set
their camp, and day by day and night by
night did they besiege it.</p>

<p>One day would the Greeks win the fight,
and the next day the Trojans would be
victors in the battle.</p>

<p>And so passed nine long years away.
To the city of Chryse one day went part of
the Greek host, sacked it, and brought back
to their camp rich spoils and many prisoners.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners was a beautiful
maiden, Chryseïs, daughter of the old priest
of the Temple of Apollo. Her did Agamemnon
choose as his part of the spoil, to be his
slave.</p>

<p>From Chryse, seeking his daughter, came
the old priest. With him he brought a rich
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>ransom to buy the freedom of Chryseïs, and
in his hands he bore a golden staff wrapped
round with the garland worn by Apollo, to
show that the god whose priest he was, was
with him in craving a boon from Agamemnon,
overlord of the Greeks.</p>

<p>‘Take this ransom, I pray you, and set ye
my dear child free,’ pled Chryses, ‘and the
gods will grant you to lay waste the city of
Troy, and to fare happily homeward.’</p>

<p>Then the Greeks gladly agreed that
Chryseïs should go home with her father,
and that the goodly ransom should be theirs.
But Agamemnon, in great wrath, drove the
old man away.</p>

<p>‘Let me not find thee, old man, lingering
here beside the ships, lest the golden staff
and garland of the god help thee naught!’
he cried. ‘Your daughter shall grow old as
my slave, and never more return to thy land.
Get ye gone!’</p>

<p>Silently along the shore of the sounding
sea walked Chryses the priest.</p>

<p>Alone he knelt down and prayed to Apollo,
his god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>‘Hear me, god of the silver bow!’ he
cried. ‘If I have built thee a temple that
is fair in thine eyes, and have offered unto
thee there the flesh of bulls and goats, hear
me! Let the Greeks be paid by thine arrows
for my tears!’</p>

<p>High up amongst the peaks of Olympus
Apollo heard the prayer of his priest, and
great anger filled his heart.</p>

<p>As dark night falls upon the earth, so did
the god come to where Agamemnon and his
armies lay. A little apart from the ships he
sat down, and drew back with a dreadful
clang the string of his silver bow.</p>

<p>Mules and dogs fell at first before his
arrows of death. Then he smote men.</p>

<p>For nine days did the Greeks fall dead at
the will of the avenging god. For nine
days did the black smoke from the funeral
pyres of the Greek warriors roll out to
sea.</p>

<p>On the tenth day Achilles, son of a
mortal warrior and a goddess, fleetest of
foot and bravest of all Greek heroes, called
an assembly of the Greeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p class="p2">‘War and pestilence ravage us,’ he said.
‘Surely it is time to inquire of a priest or
soothsayer why it is that Apollo is so
wroth.’</p>

<p>Then Chalcas, wisest of soothsayers,
arose and spoke.</p>

<p>‘These woes have come upon us,’ said
he, ‘for the wrong that Agamemnon hath
done to Chryses, priest of Apollo. With his
arrows of pestilence Apollo will not cease
to slay until we have given the bright-eyed
Chryseïs back to her father, unbought and
unransomed, and have taken a hundred
beasts and offered them up at Chryse as a
sacrifice to the angry god.’</p>

<p>So spake Chalcas, and sate him down.</p>

<p>There uprose then from his seat the great
Agamemnon, black anger in his heart, and
with eyes flashing fire.</p>

<p>‘Ill prophet art thou indeed, Chalcas!’
he cried. ‘Naught but evil hast thou ever
foretold to me! I would not take a goodly
ransom for Chryseïs, because I love her even
more than I love my own wedded wife. Yet
will I give her back, rather than that my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>people should perish. But another prize
must I have! Why should I alone, of all
the Greeks, have my prize taken from me?
It is not seemly that it should be so.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, nay! most noble Agamemnon,’ said
Achilles. ‘Too greedy art thou for gain.
We have no common store of treasure with
which to repay thee for that thou hast lost.
What spoil we got from the cities we have
taken hath already been divided. Nay, give
back Chryseïs to her father, and when next
we sack a city, thine shall be the richest
spoil of all.’</p>

<p>‘Dost seek to cheat me, Achilles?’ answered
the angry Agamemnon. ‘Wouldst
thou rob me of my prize and give me naught
instead? If thou wilt not give me the reward
my honour seeks, then will I seize it for myself&mdash;be
it thine, or that of Odysseus, or the
spoil of any other; wroth will be he to whomsoever
I come. But of this hereafter. Now
let us launch a black ship on the sea, and
in it embark Chryseïs of the fair cheeks,
and with her send an offering of beasts,
that Apollo the Far-Darter may have his
sacrifice.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Then Achilles, with black brows, looked at
Agamemnon.</p>

<p>‘Shameless art thou!’ he cried, ‘shameless
and crafty. For thy sake and that of
Menelaus thy brother left I my home and
fared across the seas to fight in Troyland.
And now thou, dog-face! dost threaten to
steal from me the spoil that I have won for
myself by weary toil and by hard fighting.
Home will I go, for I have no mind to fight
for one who is greedy for riches and wealth,
and cares not if I am dishonoured.’</p>

<p>‘Flee, then, if thou wilt,’ answered Agamemnon.
‘Others I have as brave as thee,
and ready to do me honour. Most hateful
art thou to me, Achilles. Ever thou lovest
strife and wars and fightings. I care not
for thee and thy wrath; and this I tell thee:
to thy hut I myself will go and take from
thee Briseis, fairest of all thy slaves, that
thou may’st know that I, Agamemnon, am
thy lord and ruler.’</p>

<p>Mad with anger was Achilles at these
words. His hand gripped his sword, and
he would have slain Agamemnon, had not
the goddess Athene stayed his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>‘Why art thou come hither?’ angrily
asked Achilles, as he looked round and
beheld the goddess at his side. ‘Art thou
come to see the insolence of Agamemnon?
Yea, I tell thee, through pride shall he lose
his life.’</p>

<p>Gently then did Athene speak to him.</p>

<p>‘To stay thine anger I came from far
Olympus,’ said she. ‘Goodly gifts shall
come to thee hereafter, Achilles. Only
stay thine hand and listen to me.’</p>

<p>Then said Achilles:</p>

<p>‘Goddess, a man must needs listen to
thee and do thy bidding, for the man who
obeys the immortal gods will also be heard
of them.’</p>

<p>Therewith did he grip his sword by its
silver hilt and thrust it back into its sheath;
yet again he spoke in wrath to Agamemnon.</p>

<p>‘Thou with face of a dog and heart of a
deer,’ he said, ‘never hast thou fought as
men should fight for the spoil! Rather dost
thou seize the booty for which thy men have
risked their lives. Surely these thy warriors
are weaklings, else this should have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>thy last wrong. But this I swear by my
sceptre which was once a tree, but never
more shall put forth leaf or twig; as surely
as that sceptre shall never again be green,
so surely shall the Greeks one day long for
Achilles when they fall in heaps dying before
the manslaying Hector. Then shalt thou
tear thy heart for anger, for that thou didst
not honour the bravest of thy warriors.’</p>

<p>So spake Achilles, and dashed on earth
his sceptre, studded with golden nails, while
near him sat Agamemnon, in furious anger.</p>

<p>With gentle words then spoke Nestor, an
old warrior of a hundred years and more,
longing to make peace.</p>

<p>But of peace Agamemnon and Achilles
would have none.</p>

<p>‘Ye may take back my slave, the fair
Briseis,’ said Achilles. ‘The Greeks gave
her to me; let the Greeks take her from
me again. Yet that moment that thou dost
dare to lay hand on aught else of mine, thy
dark blood shall gush about my spear.’</p>

<p>Then was the assembly at an end, and on
a fleet ship Chryseïs of the fair cheeks was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>placed, and with her were sent a hundred
beasts for a sacrifice to Apollo. With them
went Odysseus and a goodly company, and
they sailed across the sea to Chryse, to
bring back to Chryses the priest his fair
daughter, and to offer a worthy sacrifice to
the angry god.</p>

<p>Then did Agamemnon call his heralds to
him.</p>

<p>‘Go ye to the tent of Achilles,’ said he,
‘and bring me Briseis, his fair slave.’</p>

<p>Unwillingly they walked along the beach
to where the tent of Achilles was pitched.
By it he sat, and well, and with a heavy
heart, he knew when he saw them what
their errand was.</p>

<p>‘Welcome, ye heralds,’ he said. ‘Ye are
not guilty in my sight. Guilty only is
Agamemnon who sent you to rob me of the
fair Briseis. Lead her away, yet be witnesses
that when Agamemnon hath sore
need of me to save his host from shameful
wreck, no help from me shall he have.’</p>

<p>Unwillingly Briseis was led away, and
Achilles watched her go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Then sitting alone on the beach of the
grey sea, Achilles wept.</p>

<p>With eager gaze his eyes swept across the
waste of water, and holding out his hands in
supplication he cried to his mother, Thetis
the silver-footed, daughter of the King of
the Sea.</p>

<p>Like a mist Thetis rose from the depths
of the green sea-waves, and came to her
sorrowing son.</p>

<p>Gently she stroked his hand, and spoke to
him soothing words.</p>

<p>‘Why dost thou weep, my child?’ she
said. ‘Tell me all the sorrow that is in thy
heart.’</p>

<p>To his goddess-mother Achilles told the
tale of the grievous dishonour that Agamemnon
had done to him, and for rage and
for grief Thetis wept with her son.</p>

<p>‘Short is to be thy life, my son,’ she said.
‘Would that I had never borne thee, rather
than that it should also be full of grief.’</p>

<p>Then did she leave him, but at dawn next
day she rose from the sea and mounted up to
Olympus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>‘Father Zeus,’ she said to the king of the
gods, ‘if ever I have given thee aid amid
gods or men, fulfil now my desire. Do
honour to my son, whose life on earth is to
be so short. Grant victory to the Trojans
while Achilles does not draw his sword.
Grant that at last the Greeks may do honour
to him to whom Agamemnon hath brought
such bitter shame.’</p>

<p>Then did Zeus bow his head and grant
her prayer.</p>

<p>And Thetis the silver-footed darted like
a diving bird down from Olympus, and
cleft the green waves as she went back
to her father in his kingdom under the sea.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE COUNCIL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">That night both gods and men slept long;
only Zeus, king of the gods, lay wakeful,
pondering in his heart how best he might do
honour to Achilles. ‘I shall send a Dream
to beguile Agamemnon,’ at length he resolved.</p>

<p>Then did he call to a Dream, for by Dreams
the gods sent their messages to mortal men.</p>

<p>‘Go now, thou evil Dream,’ said Zeus, ‘go
to where Agamemnon sleeps in his tent near
to his fleet ships, and tell him every word as
I shall tell it thee. Bid him call to arms with
speed his warriors, for now he shall take the
strong city of Troy.’</p>

<p>To the tent of Agamemnon sped the Dream.
Taking the form of the old warrior who had
striven to make peace between Agamemnon
and Achilles, the Dream stooped over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>sleeping warrior, and thus to him it
spoke:</p>

<p>‘Sleepest thou, Agamemnon? Ill fits it
for the overlord of so mighty a host to sleep
all through the night. From Zeus I come,
and to thee he sends this message: Call to
arms with speed thy warriors, Agamemnon,
for now shalt thou take the strong city of
Troy.’</p>

<p>Off then sped the Dream, winging its way
like a strip of grey mist aloft to Mount
Olympus.</p>

<p>Then Agamemnon awoke from sleep, and
the voice of the Dream still rang in his ears.</p>

<p>Speedily he arose from his bed, donned his
fair tunic, cast around him his great cloak,
and bound his sandals on his feet. Then
over his shoulder he cast his silver-studded
sword, and with the sceptre of his house,
token of his overlordship, in his hand, he
went down to where the Greek ships lay,
and called a council together.</p>

<p>To his lords he told what had befallen him
as they slept.</p>

<p>‘Call to arms!’ had been the message
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>from Zeus. ‘Call to arms! for victory shall
be thine.’</p>

<p>Then said the old warrior in whose likeness
the Dream had come:</p>

<p>‘My friends, had any other told us this
dream we might deem it false; but to our
overlord the Dream hath come. Let us then
call our men to arms.’</p>

<p>So did all the lords follow his counsel, and
quickly did the Greeks obey their summons.
Like bees that pour from out their nests in
some hollow rock, and fly to where the spring
flowers grow most sweet, even so did the
warriors pour forth from their ships and their
huts by the sea. Loudly they shouted as
they came, till all the earth echoed. Nine
heralds sought to quiet them, but it was
long before they would cease their noise,
and sit silent to listen to the voice of
Agamemnon their lord.</p>

<p>Then did Agamemnon prove his people.
‘Ill hath Zeus dealt with us, my friends,’ he
said. ‘To us he promised ere we sailed
hither that victory should be ours. But nine
years have passed away, and our ships’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>timbers have rotted, and the rigging is
worn. In our halls our wives and children
still sit awaiting us, yet are we no nearer
victory than we were on the day that we
came hither. Come then, let us flee with
our ships to our dear native land, for never
shall Troy be ours.’</p>

<p>So spake Agamemnon, and stirred the
hearts of all that had not heard his secret
council.</p>

<p>As the high sea-waves are swayed by the
winds that rush upon them from the east and
from the south, even so the Greek host was
swayed. And even as the west wind sweeps
over a cornfield and all the ears bow down
before the blast, so were the warriors stirred.</p>

<p>Shouting, they hastened down to their
ships. And the dust rose up in clouds from
under their hurrying feet.</p>

<p>Quickly did they prepare their ships, and
gladly did they make them ready to sail
homeward across the bright salt sea.</p>

<p>Then would the Greeks have returned,
even though fate willed it not. But Hera
spoke to Athene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>‘Shall we indeed allow the Greeks thus to
flee homeward?’ she cried. ‘Shame it will
be to us if Helen is left in Troy, and Paris
goes unpunished. Haste, then, and with thy
gentle words hold back the men from setting
forth in their ships for their own homeland.’</p>

<p>Down from the peaks of Olympus darted
the bright-eyed Athene, down to where
the dark ships were being dragged to the
launching ways.</p>

<p>By his ship stood Odysseus of the many
devices, and heavy of heart was he.</p>

<p>As one who speaks aloud the thoughts of
another, so then to Odysseus spake the fair
goddess who was ever his guide.</p>

<p>‘Will ye indeed fling yourselves upon
your ships and flee homeward to your own
land?’ she said. ‘Will brave Odysseus leave
Helen, for whose sake so many Greeks have
died, to be the boast of the men of Troy?
Hasten, then, and suffer not the Greeks to
drag their ships down to the sea.’</p>

<p>At the sound of the voice of Athene, Odysseus
cast away his mantle and ran to meet
Agamemnon. From him he received the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>sceptre of overlordship, and bearing it he
went among the ships.</p>

<p>Whenever he saw a chief, he would say to
him with gentle words:</p>

<p>‘Good sir, it fits thee ill to be a coward.
Stay, now, for thou knowest not what is the
will of Agamemnon. He is only making
trial of thee. Hold back then thy people,
and anger him not.’</p>

<p>But when Odysseus met a common man
hasting to the ships, with his sceptre he
smote him, saying:</p>

<p>‘Sit still, sir, and listen to the words of thy
betters. No warrior art thou, but a weakling.
One king only hath Zeus given to us.
Hearken then to the will of Agamemnon!’</p>

<p>Thus did Odysseus rule the people, driving
them back from the ships to where sat
Agamemnon.</p>

<p>And the noise they made in returning was
as the noise of mighty waves of the sea, when
they crash upon the beach and drive their
roaring echoes far abroad.</p>

<p>Silence came upon them as they sate themselves
down before Agamemnon and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>lords. Upon all but one did silence fall.
Thersites, bandy-legged, round-shouldered,
lame of one foot, with ugly head covered
with scanty stubble, most ill-favoured of all
men in the host, would not hold his peace.</p>

<p>Shrilly he poured his upbraidings upon
Agamemnon.</p>

<p>‘What lackest thou now?’ he cried.
‘Surely thy huts are full of the spoils we
have brought to thee each time we have
taken a town. What more dost thou want?
Soft fools, women, not men, are ye Greeks,
else would ye return home now with the ships,
and leave this fellow here in Troyland gorging
himself on the spoils for which he himself
hath never fought. To brave Achilles hath he
done dishonour, a far better man than he!’</p>

<p>Straight to the side of Thersites came the
goodly Odysseus.</p>

<p>‘Hold thy peace,’ he sternly said. ‘Plainly
I tell thee that if ever again I find thee raving
as thou hast raved now, I myself will
strip off thy mantle and tunic, with shameful
blows beat thee out of the assembly, and
send thee back weeping to the ships.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>So spake Odysseus, and with his sceptre
smote Thersites on his back and shoulders.
And Thersites bowed down, and big tears
fell from his eyes, and a bloody weal from
the golden sceptre stood up from his back.
Amazed he sat down, and in pain and amazement
he wiped away a tear. The others,
though they were sorry, laughed at his
bewilderment.</p>

<p>‘Many are the good deeds of Odysseus,’
said they, ‘but never did he do a better deed
than when he stopped the tongue of this
prating railer.’</p>

<p>Then spake Odysseus, sceptre in hand.</p>

<p>‘Surely it is the wish of the Greeks to
make thee the most despised of all kings,
great Agamemnon,’ he said, ‘for like young
children or mourning women do they wail
that they must go home. Nine years have
we stayed in this land, and small wonder is
it that we long for our homes again. Yet
shameful would it be to wait so long and to
return with empty hands. Be of good heart,
my friends, and wait a little, for surely Troy
shall be ours. Do ye forget, on the day that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>we set sail for Troyland, the mighty portent
that we saw? As we offered sacrifices
to the gods beneath a fair plane-tree whence
flowed clear water, a snake, blood-red on the
back and dreadful to look upon, glided from
beneath the altar and darted to the tree. On
the tree’s topmost bough was a sparrow’s
nest, and in it eight tender nestlings, over
which the mother-bird spread her wings.
Pitifully did the little ones cheep as the
snake swallowed them all, and pitifully cried
the mother as she fluttered over her nestlings.
But of her, too, did the snake lay hold, coiling
himself round her and crushing her life
out. Then did the god who sent this sign
show us that a sign from the gods in truth
it was, for he turned the snake into stone.
And Chalcas, our soothsayer, told us then
the meaning of the sign. “Nine years,” said
he&mdash;for nine birds did the snake slay&mdash;“shall
ye fight in Troyland, but in the tenth
year the city shall fall before you.” So then,
let us abide here, until we have taken the
great city!’</p>

<p>When Odysseus had ceased to speak, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>Greeks shouted aloud, until the ships echoed
the praises of the goodly Odysseus.</p>

<p>Then said Agamemnon:</p>

<p>‘Go now, all of you, and eat, that ye may
be ready for battle. Let each man sharpen
well his spear and see to his shield, and
see to it that the horses are well fed and
the chariots prepared. And whomsoever I
see minded to stay far away from the
fight, beside the ships here by the sea, for
him shall there be no hope hereafter, but
he shall be food for dogs and for birds of
prey.’</p>

<p>And when Agamemnon had spoken, the
shouts of the Greeks were as the thunder of
mighty breakers on a reef when the winds
blow high.</p>

<p>Quickly then they scattered, and kindled
fires, and made their evening meal, and
offered sacrifices to the gods, praying for
escape from death in the coming battle.</p>

<p>To Zeus did Agamemnon offer his sacrifice,
and to the mighty god he prayed:</p>

<p>‘Great Zeus, god of the storm-cloud, let
not the sun set nor the darkness fall until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>I have laid low the palaces of Troy and
burned down its walls with fire.’</p>

<p>So he prayed, but as yet Zeus heeded not
his prayer. Then did the Greeks gather
themselves together to battle, and amongst
them went the bright-eyed Athene, urging
on each one, and rousing in each man’s
heart the joy of strength and of battle.</p>

<p>As the red and golden blaze of a fire that
devours a mighty forest is seen from afar,
so was seen from afar the dazzling gleam of
their bronze armour as they marched.</p>

<p>Like wild geese and cranes and swans that
in long-drawn strings fly tirelessly onward,
so poured they forth, while the earth echoed
terribly under the tread of men and horses.</p>

<p>As flies that swarm in the spring when the
herdsmen’s milk-pails are full, so did the
Greeks throng to battle, unnumbered as the
leaves and the flowers upon which they trod
in the flowery plain by the banks of the river
Scamander.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE FIGHT BETWEEN PARIS<br />
AND MENELAUS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">To meet the great Greek host came the men
of Troy. With loud shouting and clamour
they came, noisy as the flocks of cranes that
fly to far-off seas before the coming of winter
and sudden rain.</p>

<p>But in silence marched the Greeks,
shoulder to shoulder, their hearts full of
courage.</p>

<p>Like the mist that rolls from the crest of
the mountains until no man can see in front
of him further than the cast of a stone, so
did the dust rise in clouds under the tread
of the warriors’ feet as they marched across
the plain.</p>

<p>Front to front did the two armies stand at
last, and from the Trojan ranks strode forth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>Paris the godlike, he who robbed Menelaus
of her who was to him most dear.</p>

<p>From the shoulders of Paris swung a
panther’s skin. He bore a curved bow and
sword, and, brandishing two bronze-headed
spears, he challenged all the chieftains of
the Greek host to fight him, man to man, in
mortal fight.</p>

<p>As a hungry lion rejoices to see a great-horned
stag coming to be his prey, even so
did Menelaus rejoice when he saw Paris, the
golden-haired and blue-eyed, stride proudly
forth.</p>

<p>Straightway, in his armour, did Menelaus
leap from his chariot to the ground.</p>

<p>But when Paris saw him to whom he
had done so sore a wrong, his heart was
smitten.</p>

<p>As a man who, in a mountain glen,
suddenly sees a deadly snake and shrinks
away from it with shaking limbs, even so
did Paris shrink back amongst his comrades.</p>

<p>Scornfully did Hector his brother behold
him.</p>

<p>‘Fair in face thou art!’ said Hector, ‘but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>shamed I am by thee! I ween these long-haired
Greeks make sport of us because we
have for champion one whose face and form
are beautiful, but in whose heart is neither
strength nor courage. Art thou a coward?
and yet thou daredst to sail across the sea
and steal from her husband the fair woman
who hath brought us so much harm. Thou
shalt see what sort of warrior is he whose
lovely wife thou hast taken. Thy harp and
thy golden locks and fair face, and all the
graces given to thee by Aphrodite, shall
count for little when thou liest in the dust!
Cowards must we Trojans be, else thou
hadst been stoned to death ere this, for all
the evil thou hast wrought.’</p>

<p>Then answered Paris:</p>

<p>‘No word hast thou said that I do not
deserve, brave Hector. Yet scorn not the
gifts of golden Aphrodite, for by his own
desire can no man win the love and beauty
that the goddess gives. But let me now
do battle with Menelaus. Make the Trojans
and the men of Greece sit down, while
Menelaus and I fight for Helen. Let him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>who is conqueror have her and all that is
hers for his own, and let the others take an
oath of friendship so that the Greeks may
depart in peace to their own land, and in
peace the Trojans dwell in Troy.’</p>

<p>Greatly did Hector rejoice at his brother’s
word. His spear grasped by the middle,
he went through the Trojan ranks and bid
the warriors hold back.</p>

<p>But as he went, the Greeks shot arrows
at brave Hector and cast stones.</p>

<p>‘Hold! hold! ye Greeks,’ called Agamemnon.
‘Hector of the glancing helm hath
somewhat to say to us.’</p>

<p>In silence, then, the two armies stood,
while Hector told them the words of Paris
his brother.</p>

<p>When they had heard him, Menelaus spoke.</p>

<p>‘Many ills have ye endured,’ he said, ‘for
my sake and because of the sins of Paris.
Yet now, I think, the end of this long war
hath come. Let us fight, then, and death
and fate shall decide which of us shall die.
Let us offer sacrifice now to Zeus, and
call hither Priam, King of Troy. I fear for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>the faith of his sons, Paris and Hector, but
Priam is an old man and will not break
faith.’</p>

<p>Then were the Greeks and the Trojans
glad. They came down from their chariots,
and took off their arms, and laid them on
the ground, while heralds went to tell Priam
and to fetch lambs and a ram for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>While they went, Hera sent to Troy Iris,
her messenger, in the guise of the fairest
daughter of Priam.</p>

<p>To the hall where Helen sat came lovely
Iris. And there she found Helen, fairest of
women, her white arms swiftly moving back
and forward as she wove a great purple
web of double wool, and wrought thereon
pictures of many battles of the Greeks and
the men of Troy.</p>

<p>‘Come hither, dear lady,’ said Iris, ‘and
see a wondrous thing. For they that so
fiercely fought with each other, now sit in
silence. The battle is stayed; they lean
upon their shields, and their tall spears are
thrust in the earth by their sides. But for
thee are Menelaus and Paris now going to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>fight, and thou shalt be the wife of the
conqueror.’</p>

<p>So spake lovely Iris, and into the sleeping
heart of Helen there came remembrance,
and a hungry longing for her old home, and
for Menelaus, and her father and mother,
and for little Hermione, her child.</p>

<p>The tears rolled down her cheeks, but
quickly she hid her face with a veil of fair
linen, and hastened out, with her two handmaidens,
to the place where the two armies
lay.</p>

<p>At the Skaian gates sat Priam and other
old warriors.</p>

<p>As Helen, in her fair white robes, drew
near, the old men marvelled at her loveliness.</p>

<p>‘Small wonder is it,’ said they, ‘that
Trojans and Greeks should suffer hardships
and lay down their lives for one so beautiful.
Yet well would it be for her to sail away
upon the Greek ships rather than stay here
to bring trouble upon us now, and upon our
children hereafter.’</p>

<p>Then Priam called to Helen:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>‘Come hither, dear child, and sit beside
me, that thou may’st see the man who once
was thy husband, and thy kinsmen, and thy
friends. No blame do I give to thee for all
our woes, but only to the gods who have
chosen thee to be the cause of all this bloodshed.’</p>

<p>Then did Priam ask her the names of the
mighty heroes who stood by their spears
in the Grecian ranks, and Helen, making
answer to him, said:</p>

<p>‘Dear father of Paris, my lord, would that
I had died ere I left my own land and my
little child, and all those that I loved, and
followed thy son hither. Agamemnon, a
goodly king and a mighty spearsman, is the
Greek warrior whose name thou dost ask.
Brother of him who was my husband is
he. Ah! shameless me, who did leave mine
own.’</p>

<p>Of Odysseus also, and of many another
warrior of great stature and brave looks, did
Priam make inquiry. And Helen told him
all she knew, while tears of longing stood in
her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>‘My two brethren, Castor, tamer of horses,
and Polydeuces, the skilful boxer, I do not
see,’ she said; ‘mayhap they have not crossed
the sea.’ For she knew not that her two
brothers lay dead in her own beautiful land.</p>

<p>Then was the sacrifice to Zeus offered,
and the vows made between Agamemnon
and Priam, King of Troy.</p>

<p>When the sacrifice and vows were accomplished,
Priam in haste mounted his chariot
and drove away.</p>

<p>‘Verily will I return to windy Ilios,’ said
the old man, ‘for I cannot bear to watch
the fight between Menelaus and my own
dear son. But only Zeus and the gods
know which one of them is to fall.’</p>

<p>Then Hector and Odysseus marked out a
space for the fight, and into a bronze helmet
Hector placed two pebbles and shook them
in the helmet, looking behind him. And
the pebble of Paris leapt out the first, so
that to him fell the lot to cast first his spear
of bronze.</p>

<p>Then did Paris arm himself. Greaves of
beauteous fashioning he placed upon his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>legs, and fastened them with silver ankle-clasps.
Over his shoulders he put his silver-studded
sword of bronze and his great shield.
On his head he placed a helmet with nodding
crest of horse-hair, and in his hand he
grasped his strong spear. In like manner
did Menelaus arm himself.</p>

<p>One moment did they stand face to face,
wrath and hatred in their hearts, their spears
gripped firm in their hands.</p>

<p>Then did Paris hurl his spear and smite
the shield of Menelaus. But the shield was
strong and the spear could not pierce it.</p>

<p>His hand lifted up for the cast, Menelaus
looked upwards and called to Zeus.</p>

<p>‘Grant me revenge, great Zeus!’ he cried.
‘On him that hath done me grievous wrong,
grant me vengeance, so that all men hereafter
may shudder to wrong one who hath
treated him as his honoured guest.’</p>

<p>Then hurled he his mighty spear. Through
the bright shield it went, and through the
shining breastplate, tearing the tunic of
Paris on his thigh. But Paris swerved
aside, and so escaped death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Then Menelaus drew his silver-studded
sword and drove it crashing down upon the
helmet of Paris. But in four pieces was the
sword shattered, and fell from the hand of
Menelaus.</p>

<p>‘Surely art thou the most cruel of all the
gods, Zeus!’ angrily he cried. ‘My spear
is cast in vain, and my sword shattered, and
my vengeance is still to come!’</p>

<p>So saying, he leapt upon Paris. By the
crest on his helmet he seized him, and,
swinging him round, he dragged him towards
the Greek host. The embroidered strap beneath
the helmet of Paris strangled him, and
so he would have shamefully died, had not
Aphrodite marked his plight. Swiftly did
she burst the leather strap, and the helmet
was left empty in the grasp of Menelaus.</p>

<p>Casting the empty helmet, with a swing,
to his comrades, Menelaus sprang back,
ready, with another spear, to slay his enemy.</p>

<p>But Aphrodite snatched Paris up, and in
thick mist she hid him, and bore him away
to his own home. Like a wild beast Menelaus
strode through the host, searching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>for him. But no Trojan would have hidden
him, for with a bitter hatred did the men of
Troy hate Paris, most beautiful of mortal
men.</p>

<p>Then said Agamemnon:</p>

<p>‘Hearken to me, ye Trojans. Now hath
Menelaus gained the victory. Give us back
Helen, and all that is hers, and pay me the
recompense that ye owe me for all the evil
days that are gone.’</p>

<p>So spake he, and glad were the shouts of
the Greeks as they heard the words of their
king.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="reduce">HOW MENELAUS WAS WOUNDED; AND<br />
THE BRAVE DEEDS OF DIOMEDES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">While Menelaus made search for Paris,
Hera and Athene plotted together, wrathfully
planning how best to bring harm upon
Paris and the men of Troy.</p>

<p>No wish had they that the grievous war
should be ended, and Paris, whom they
hated, allowed to go unpunished.</p>

<p>Like a shooting-star that flashes through
the sky, even so did Athene haste down to
the earth from Olympus.</p>

<p>In the guise of a man she sought Pandarus,
a gallant warrior and a mighty archer.</p>

<p>‘Hearken to me, wise Pandarus,’ said the
goddess. ‘Shoot now a swift arrow at Menelaus,
that thou may’st slay him. So shalt
thou win fame and glory before all the
Trojans, and gain from Paris kingly gifts.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>And to her words foolish Pandarus lent
willing ears.</p>

<p>He unsheathed his polished bow, made
from the horn of a wild ibex that he himself
had shot in the mountains. Sixteen palms
long were its horns, and these a skilled
workman had polished well and joined cunningly
together, and tipped with gold. Well
did Pandarus string his bow, and from his
quiver he chose an arrow, sharp and new.
Then did he pull back the bowstring to his
breast until the great bow was bent into a
round. The horn twanged and the bowstring
sang, and the keen arrow sped fiercely on its
way. Straight to the heart of Menelaus
would it have sped, but Athene made it
glance aside, so that it smote against the
golden buckles of the belt of his breastplate.
Yet even then did it graze his flesh, and the
black blood gushed forth from the wound.</p>

<p>When Agamemnon saw the blood flowing,
sorely grieved was he.</p>

<p>But Menelaus said:</p>

<p>‘Be of good courage. The wound is not
deep, for my glistering belt in front and my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>kirtle of mail beneath stayed the deadly
arrow.’</p>

<p>Then did they send for a skilled physician.
And he, when he was come, drew forth the
arrow, and sucked the blood and spread
healing drugs upon the wound.</p>

<p>While the physician tended Menelaus,
throughout the Greek host went Agamemnon.</p>

<p>‘To arms!’ he said to his men. ‘The men
of Troy have broken the oath of peace that
they took, and for us it is to punish them.
No helper of liars is Zeus, and so shall they
fall before us and their flesh be given to the
vultures for their food!’</p>

<p>All those of his men that he found preparing
eagerly for the battle, he praised. But
to those that he found shrinking from battle
he gave angry words, whether they were
common soldiers or great chiefs.</p>

<p>To Diomedes he came at last.</p>

<p>‘Dost thou hold back from battle, Diomedes?’
he cried. ‘Such was not thy
father’s way. Ever in battle was he the
first. But his son is not a fighter such as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>he, though in speech he may be more
skilled.’</p>

<p>No answer did Diomedes make, for he
reverenced Agamemnon the king.</p>

<p>But a comrade who stood by him cried out
in anger at the injustice of his words.</p>

<p>‘Falsely dost thou speak, Agamemnon!’
he said. ‘Better men than our fathers are
we! Did we not, with fewer men and
against a stronger wall, take the great city
of Thebes which they strove to take in
vain!’</p>

<p>But brave Diomedes sternly rebuked him.
‘Be silent, brother,’ he said, ‘for right and
just it is that Agamemnon should urge his
warriors on to the fight. His will be the
glory if we overcome the men of Troy and
take their city, and his will be the great
sorrow if by the Trojans we Greeks are laid
low. Come! let us to arms!’</p>

<p>From his chariot Diomedes leapt to the
ground, and his armour clanged as he
moved.</p>

<p>And as the great sea-billows raise their
heads before the driving of the gale, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>crash themselves in fury against the shore,
casting afar their briny spray and foam, even
as mightily did the Greeks move onward to
battle. Horse after horse, and man after
man, went as the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>But like bleating sheep were the Trojans
as they awaited the coming of their
foes.</p>

<p>And amongst the men of Troy fought
Mars, god of war, and for the Greeks fought
Athene, and with her were Terror and Rout,
and Strife that never wearies.</p>

<p>So did the armies meet. Like wolves they
fought. Man lashed at man; with blood the
earth grew red, and the clamour of their
fighting was as the noise of the meeting of
the mountain streams when they rush in
furious spate into the valleys in the winter
floods.</p>

<p>Like trees that the woodmen cut and send
crashing to the ground, so fell first one hero,
then another. First fell a man of Troy, then
a Greek. On that day many a Trojan and
many a Greek side by side in the dust lay
dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Now was it that to Diomedes Athene
came and gave fresh strength and courage.
From his helmet she made a light to shine,
burning brightly as a star in summer.</p>

<p>Amongst the Trojans were two brothers,
rich and noble, and well-skilled warriors.</p>

<p>One of them from their chariot cast his
spear at Diomedes, who was on foot, but
missed his aim. And Diomedes then cast
his spear and smote his enemy in the breast,
so that from his chariot he fell dead on the
ground, while his brother fled, lest he, too,
should be slain. He left his beautiful chariot
behind, and Diomedes drove away the horses
and gave them to his men to keep for him.</p>

<p>And Athene, watching the fray, took the
god Mars by the hand and led him aside.</p>

<p>‘Let us leave the Greeks and Trojans to
fight,’ said she, ‘and let Zeus give the victory
to whom he will.’</p>

<p>Then did Mars sit him down by the river
Scamander, and again Greeks and Trojans
fought without aid from the gods.</p>

<p>Like heroes they fought. Like heroes
they slew and died. But none fought as did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>Diomedes. Like a winter torrent in full flood
did he charge across the plain, driving all
before him.</p>

<p>But when Pandarus the archer saw him
coming against him in triumph, he bent his
bow and drove an arrow in haste to meet
him. And in one moment the corslet of
Diomedes was dabbled with blood.</p>

<p>Then loudly shouted Pandarus:</p>

<p>‘Bestir you, brave Trojans! The best
man of the Greeks is wounded, and soon
shall he die from the arrow that I sped
against him!’</p>

<p>So boasted Pandarus, but Diomedes leapt
down from his chariot, and to his charioteer
he spoke:</p>

<p>‘Haste thee, and draw from my shoulder
this bitter arrow.’</p>

<p>Speedily the charioteer drew the arrow
forth, and from the wound the blood spurted
upward.</p>

<p>Then cried Diomedes:</p>

<p>‘Hear me, Athene! If ever thou didst
stand by my father in heat of battle, stand
now by me. Bring me within a spear’s thrust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>of this man who hath wounded me, and grant
that I may slay him.’</p>

<p>So he prayed, and Athene heard him.</p>

<p>‘Be of good courage, Diomedes,’ she said.
‘Thy prayer is granted. But if thou shouldst
meet any of the gods in battle, smite none of
them save golden Aphrodite.’</p>

<p>Then did Diomedes turn back to the battle,
and threefold courage came upon him, so that
he fought as fights an angry lion.</p>

<p>Ten warriors, brave and gallant, fell
before him, and the horses of these he
took and gave to his men to drive to the
ships.</p>

<p>Then said Aeneas, captain of the Trojan
host, son of a mortal warrior and of the goddess
Aphrodite:</p>

<p>‘Where are thy bows and arrows, Pandarus?
Canst thou not slay this man who
makes havoc of the host?’</p>

<p>‘Methinks this man is Diomedes,’ answered
Pandarus. ‘Already have I smitten him, but
without avail. Surely he is no man, but a
wrathful god. Behind me in my own dear
land left I eleven fair chariots, each with its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>yoke of horses, for I feared that my good
horses might not find fodder in the camp.
So now have I no chariot but only my bow,
and now is my bow of no help to me, for
Menelaus and Diomedes have I smitten, yet
they have not died.’</p>

<p>Then said Aeneas:</p>

<p>‘Talk not thus, but mount in my chariot
and take the reins and whip, and I myself
will stand upon the car and fight with
Diomedes.’</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ said Pandarus, ‘take thou thyself
the reins. Should thy horses be driven by
one they know not, and hear a strange voice
from him who drives them, mad might they
go with fear. So drive thine own horses,
Aeneas, and with my spear will I go against
Diomedes.’</p>

<p>In the chariot then mounted Aeneas and
Pandarus, and swiftly galloped the horses
against Diomedes. His charioteer saw them
coming and to Diomedes he said:</p>

<p>‘Pandarus and Aeneas come against us,
Diomedes&mdash;mighty warriors both. Let us
haste back to our chariot.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>‘Speak not of flight!’ answered Diomedes.
‘It is not in my blood to skulk or cower
down. As for these, both shall not escape
me. But if Athene grant that I slay them
both, then stay my chariot where it is, binding
the reins to the chariot rim, and leap
upon the horses of Aeneas and drive them
forth into the host of the Greeks. For truly
there are no better horses under the sun
than these horses of Aeneas.’</p>

<p>When Pandarus and Aeneas drew near,
fiercely Pandarus hurled his bronze-shod
spear. Through the shield of Diomedes it
passed, and reached his breastplate.</p>

<p>‘Thou art hit in the loin!’ cried Pandarus;
‘now, methinks, thou soon shalt die.’</p>

<p>But Diomedes, unafraid, replied:</p>

<p>‘Nay! thou hast missed and not hit.’</p>

<p>With that he hurled his spear. Through
the nose and teeth and tongue of Pandarus
it passed, and from the chariot he fell, his
gleaming armour clanging on the ground.
And it was from a dead man that the horses
swerved aside.</p>

<p>Then Aeneas leapt from his chariot and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>stood astride the lifeless body, like a lion at
bay, fearful lest the Greeks should take from
him the body of his friend.</p>

<p>In his hand Diomedes seized a mighty
stone, and with it smote Aeneas on the thigh,
crushing the bone, and tearing the skin.
On his knees fell the great Aeneas, and soon
must he have perished, but Aphrodite saw
the peril of her son and wound her white
arms about him, and would have borne him
safely away. But Diomedes, leaping in his
chariot, pursued her, and with his spear he
wounded her sorely on the wrist. With a
great cry Aphrodite let fall her son, but
another of the gods was near and bore him
away in the covering of a cloud.</p>

<p>‘Away with thee, Aphrodite!’ called Diomedes.
‘It is surely enough for thee to
beguile feeble women and to keep away
from battle!’</p>

<p>Then upon Aeneas he leapt, not knowing
that it was a god whose arms held him.
Three times did he seek fiercely to slay
Aeneas, and three times did the god beat
him back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>‘Thou warrest with the gods! Have a
care, Diomedes!’ shouted the god in a
terrible voice, and Diomedes for a little
shrank back.</p>

<p>Then truly did the gods come to war
against Greeks and Trojans, for Mars and
Athene and Hera in fury fought amongst the
hosts.</p>

<p>‘Shame on ye! men of Greece,’ cried
Athene. ‘While noble Achilles went forth
to war, the Trojans dared scarcely pass without
their gates, but now they bring their
fighting close to the ships on the beach!’
So she roused the Greeks to further fury.</p>

<p>To Diomedes then she went. Him she found
beside his chariot, wiping away the blood
from the wound dealt him by Pandarus.</p>

<p>‘An unworthy son of thy brave father art
thou, Diomedes,’ she said. ‘Alone would
thy father fight; but though I stand by thy
side to guard thee, either weariness or fear
hath taken hold on thee.’</p>

<p>‘I have no fear, neither am I weary,’
answered Diomedes, ‘but thou hast told me
to smite none of the gods save Aphrodite,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>and now see I the god Mars leading the
men of Troy. So have I stayed my hand and
called back my men from the battle.’</p>

<p>Then answered bright-eyed Athene:</p>

<p>‘Diomedes, joy of mine heart, fear not
Mars nor any other of the gods, for I am thy
helper. Go now, guide thy chariot against
Mars and smite him hand to hand. This
day did he promise me to fight for the Greeks,
and now he fights against them.’</p>

<p>So saying, she made the charioteer of
Diomedes give her his place, and herself,
with whip and reins, did she guide the fiery
horses.</p>

<p>And Mars, seeing the chariot of Diomedes
draw near, leaving many dead behind him,
eagerly came to meet it. With furious thrust
did he drive his spear at Diomedes, but
Athene seized it in her hand and turned it
aside. Then did Diomedes thrust at Mars
with his spear of bronze, and it Athene
guided so that it pierced the thigh of the
god of war. Loud as nine thousand or ten
thousand warriors cry in battle, did Mars
bellow with rage and pain, and like a thunder-cloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
he swept upwards through the sky to
Olympus.</p>

<p>And still the fight went on, and sorrow
came to many from the slaying of that day.</p>

<span class="reduce">HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">From where the battle still raged went
Hector, son of Priam. At the oak tree by
the gates of Troy there came running to
meet him wives and daughters of those who
fought. For eagerly did they long for tidings
of many a warrior who now lay dead on the
field.</p>

<p>When he reached the beautiful, many-pillared
palace of his father, his mother came
to meet him.</p>

<p>His hand she took in hers, and gently
spoke she to him.</p>

<p>‘Art thou wearied that thou hast left the
battle, Hector, my son?’ she said. ‘Let me
bring thee wine that thou may’st be refreshed
and yet gain strength.’</p>

<p>‘Bring me no wine, dear mother,’ said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>Hector, ‘lest it take from me the strength
and courage that I have. Rather go thou
to the temple of Athene and offer her
sacrifices, beseeching that she will have
mercy on Troy and on the wives of the
Trojans and their little children. So may
she hold back Diomedes the destroyer. I
go to Paris&mdash;would that he were dead!’</p>

<p>And the mother of Hector straightway,
with other old women, the mothers of heroes,
offered sacrifices and prayers to Athene.
But Athene paid no heed.</p>

<p>To the palace of Paris, his mighty bronze
spear in his hand, then strode Hector.</p>

<p>Paris, the golden-haired, sat in a room
with Helen, idly handling his shining shield
and breastplate and curved bow.</p>

<p>In bitter scorn spoke Hector to his
brother.</p>

<p>‘Our people die in battle for thy sake!’
he cried, ‘while here thou sittest idle. Up
then, ere the enemies that thou hast made
for us burn our city to the ground!’</p>

<p>And Paris answered:</p>

<p>‘Justly dost thou chide me, Hector. Even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>now hath Helen urged me to play the man
and go back to battle. Only let me put on
my armour, and soon will I overtake thee.’</p>

<p>Never a word did Hector answer him.</p>

<p>But to Hector did Helen then speak.</p>

<p>‘Brother Hector,’ she said, ‘unworthy am
I to be sister of thine. Would that I had
died on the day I was born, or would that
the gods who have brought me this evil had
given me for a husband one who was shamed
by reproach and who feared dishonour.
Rest thee here, my brother, who hast
suffered so much for the sake of wretched
me and for the sin of Paris. Well I know
that for us cometh punishment of which
men will sing in the far-off years that are
yet to come.’</p>

<p>‘Of thy love, ask me not to stay, Helen,’
answered Hector. ‘For to help the men of
Troy is my whole heart set, and they are
now in want of me. But rouse this fellow,
and make him hasten after me. I go now
to see my dear wife and my babe, for
I know not whether I shall return to them
again.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>In his own house Hector found not his
fair wife Andromache, nor their little babe.</p>

<p>‘Whither went thy mistress?’ he asked
in eagerness of the serving-women.</p>

<p>‘Truly, my lord,’ answered one, ‘tidings
came to us that the Trojans were sorely
pressed and that with the Greeks was the
victory. So then did Andromache, like one
frenzied, hasten with her child and his nurse
to the walls that she might see somewhat
of what befell. There, on the tower, she
stands now, weeping and wailing.’</p>

<p>Back through the streets by which he had
come then hastened Hector. And as he
drew near the gates, Andromache, who had
spied him from afar, ran to meet him.</p>

<p>As, hand clasped in hand, Andromache
and Hector stood, Hector looked silently
at the beautiful babe in his nurse’s arms, and
smiled.</p>

<p>Astyanax, ‘The City King,’ those of Troy
called the child, because it was Hector his
father who saved the city.</p>

<p>Then said Andromache:</p>

<p>‘Dear lord, thy courage will bring thee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>death. Hast thou no pity for this babe
nor for thy wife, who so soon shall be thy
widow? Better would it be for me to die
if to thee death should come. For if I lose
thee, then sorrow must for evermore be
mine. No father nor mother have I, and on
one day were my seven brothers slain.
Father and mother and brother art thou to
me, Hector, and my dear loved husband as
well. Have pity now, and stay with thy
wife and thy little child.’</p>

<p>‘All these things know I well, my wife,’
answered Hector, ‘but black shame would
be mine were I to shrink like a coward from
battle. Ever it hath been mine to be
where the fight was fiercest, and to win
glory for my father’s name, and for my own.
But soon will that glory be gone, for my
heart doth tell me that Troy must fall. Yet
for the sorrows of the Trojans, and of my
own father and mother and brethren, and
of the many heroes that must perish, grieve
I less bitterly than for the anguish that must
come upon thee on that day when thou no
longer hast a husband to fight for thee and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>a Greek leads thee away a prisoner. May
the earth be heaped up high above me ere
I hear thy crying, Andromache!’</p>

<p>So spake Hector, and stretched out his
arms to take his boy.</p>

<p>But from his father’s bronze helmet with
its fiercely nodding plume of horse-hair the
babe shrank back in terror and hid his face
in his nurse’s breast. Then did the little
City King’s father and his sweet mother
laugh aloud, and on the ground Hector laid
his helmet, and taking his little son in his
arms he kissed him and gently dandled him.
And as he did so, thus Hector prayed to Zeus
and all the gods:</p>

<p>‘O Zeus and all ye gods, grant that my
son may be a brave warrior and a great
king in Troyland. Let men say of him
when he returns from battle, “Far greater is
he than his father,” and may he gladden his
mother’s heart.’</p>

<p>Then did Hector lay his babe in Andromache’s
arms, and she held him to her bosom,
smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>Full of love and pity and tenderness was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>the heart of Hector, and gently he caressed
her and said:</p>

<p>‘Dear one, I pray thee be not of over-sorrowful
heart. No man shall slay me ere
the time appointed for my death hath come.
Go home and busy thyself with loom and
distaff and see to the work of thy maidens.
But war is for us men, and of all those who
dwell in Troyland, most of all for me.’</p>

<p>So spake Hector, and on his head again he
placed his crested helmet. And his wife went
home, many times looking back to watch him
she loved going forth to battle, with her eyes
half blinded by her tears.</p>

<p>Not far behind Hector followed Paris, his
armour glittering like the sun, and with a
laugh on the face that was more full of beauty
than that of any other man on earth. Like a
noble charger that has broken its bonds and
gallops exultingly across the plain, so did
Paris stride onward.</p>

<p>‘I fear I have delayed thee,’ he said to his
brother when he overtook him.</p>

<p>‘No man can speak lightly of thy courage,’
answered Hector, ‘only thou hast brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>shame on thyself by holding back from battle.
But now let us go forward, and may the gods
give the Greeks into our hands.’</p>

<p>So went Hector and Paris together into
battle, and many a Greek fell before them on
that day.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE FIGHT BETWEEN HECTOR AND AJAX</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">From Olympus did Athene mark with angry
heart how Greek after Greek fell dead before
the spears of Hector and of Paris.</p>

<p>Then did she plot with Apollo, her brother,
how best she might discomfit these men of
Troy.</p>

<p>And into the heart of Hector did they put
the wish to make the Trojans and the Greeks
cease from battle, while he challenged the
bravest Greek of the host to meet him, man
to man, in deadly combat.</p>

<p>Then did Hector and Agamemnon make
the fighting cease, and with gladness did
Hector call upon the Greeks to send forth
their bravest champion that he might fight
with him, hand to hand.</p>

<p>‘If I be slain,’ said Hector, ‘then let the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>victor despoil me of my armour, but give
back my body to my home. And if I slay
him who fights with me, then shall his armour
be mine. But his body the Greeks shall have,
that they may build for him a tomb in their
own land, near the sea, so that in the days to
come men may look at it as they sail past in
their ships and say, “This is the tomb of a
man that died in days of old, a champion
whom Hector slew.”’</p>

<p>Silent stood the Greeks before him. For
they feared to meet him hand to hand, and
were ashamed to show their fear.</p>

<p>Then up sprang Menelaus, and with scorn
of the others he donned his armour.</p>

<p>‘Shame on ye all!’ he cried. ‘I myself
will fight with Hector, and the gods will slay
that man whom they will to die.’</p>

<p>But Agamemnon would not have it that
his brother should fight.</p>

<p>‘This is madness, Menelaus,’ he said.
‘Draw back, though it pains thee, for even
Achilles did dread to meet this man in battle,
and how much more mighty is Achilles than
thou.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Then rose up nine chiefs of the Greeks, all
ready to fight with Hector, and lots were cast
to see which of these, the most valiant of the
host, should meet with the champion of the
men of Troy.</p>

<p>To Ajax the giant-like did the lot fall, and
glad was the heart of the hero that so it
should be.</p>

<p>In his shining bronze armour did Ajax
array him, and as he strode forward with a
smile on his stern face and his long spear
brandished in his hand, he looked as looks
Mars the terrible when he goes forth to
battle.</p>

<p>The Trojans trembled at the sight, and the
heart of Hector beat faster, as the giant, with
his great bronze shield, came towards him
with mighty strides.</p>

<p>‘Achilles, the lion-hearted, sitteth by his
ships, yet shalt thou be shown, Hector, that
the Greeks have other warriors in their
ranks,’ cried Ajax. ‘But thou shalt begin
the battle.’</p>

<p>‘Am I a woman or a feeble boy who knows
naught of fighting, Ajax?’ answered Hector.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>‘Well do I know the rules of the great
game of war. But I have no mind to smite
thee by cunning. Openly shall I smite thee,
if I smite at all.’</p>

<p>Thereat he hurled at Ajax his bronze-shod
spear. But on his mighty shield of sevenfold
hide, bronze-covered, Ajax caught the
blow, and only six folds of the shield were
pierced.</p>

<p>Then did Ajax the giant hurt his spear,
and it passed through Hector’s bright shield
and his corslet, and rent the doublet on his
thigh. But Hector swerved aside and so
escaped death. Then did each grip a fresh
spear, and, like angry lions, did they rush each
at the other. Again did Hector smite the
shield of Ajax with his spear, but the spear
point was bent back and unpierced was the
shield. And Ajax, with a mighty drive, sent
his spear through the shield of Hector, and
the point pierced his neck, so that the dark
blood gushed forth. But even then Hector
ceased not to fight. From the ground he
seized up a great jagged stone and hurled
it against the shield of Ajax, until the bronze
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>rang again. A stone, greater by far, did
Ajax then hurl, and the shield of Hector
was crushed inwards, and Hector was borne
backwards, and fell, and had been slain, had
not Apollo, with invisible hands, raised him
up. Their swords they drew then, and would
have fought on, had not heralds rushed between
them and with their staves held them
apart.</p>

<p>‘Fight no more, dear sons,’ said the herald
of Troy. ‘Well do we see that ye both are
brave warriors, and well-beloved of Zeus.
But night falleth, and bids you cease the
combat.’</p>

<p>Said Ajax:</p>

<p>‘For Hector it is to speak, for he challenged
the bravest of the Greeks to battle. As he
wills, so shall I do.’</p>

<p>‘The gods have given thee stature and
might and wisdom, Ajax,’ said Hector, ‘and
surely there is no greater fighter among the
Greeks than thou. Night falleth, so let us
cease from battle, and hereafter will we fight
again, and the gods shall grant one of us
the victory. But now let us exchange gifts,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>that Greeks and Trojans may say, “In fierce
strife did Ajax and Hector meet, but in
friendship they parted.”’</p>

<p>So spoke Hector, and gave to Ajax his
silver-studded sword, with scabbard and
sword-belt; and to him did Ajax give his belt
bright with purple.</p>

<p>So parted the two heroes, and greatly did
the men of Troy and of Greece rejoice at the
safe return of their champions.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE BURNING OF THE DEAD; AND THE<br />
BATTLE OF THE PLAIN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">With feasting did the Greeks do honour to
Ajax, and when the feast was ended, Nestor,
the oldest and the most wise of the warriors,
gave counsel that at daybreak on the morrow
they should gather the bodies of their dead
and burn them on a great pyre.</p>

<p>But while the Greek chiefs in peace took
council together, they of Troy with fierce
and angry words disputed at a gate of their
city.</p>

<p>Said one:</p>

<p>‘How can we hope to prosper in the fight
when our oath is broken? Let us then give
back to the Greeks fair Helen and all her
wealth.’</p>

<p>But Paris, in wrath, made reply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>‘Mad indeed thou art if thou dost think
I will do as thou sayest! The wealth of
Helen will I return with a willing heart, and
to it add more wealth of mine own. But
Helen my wife will I give back never!’</p>

<p>At dawn on the morrow did the Trojan
heralds come to the camp of Agamemnon
and gave to him the message.</p>

<p>‘Thus saith Priam of Troy and all his
nobles, The wealth that Helen brought with
her to Troy will Paris return, and more
besides of his own, but the beautiful wife
of Menelaus he saith he will not give. But
grant to us a truce until we have buried our
dead, and then again will we fight until the
gods grant us victory.’</p>

<p>Then said Diomedes:</p>

<p>‘Let us take none of the treasures of
Helen nor of Paris, neither Helen herself
for well we know that the days of Troy
are already numbered.’</p>

<p>In applause of the words of Diomedes the
Greek host shouted, and Agamemnon said
to the heralds:</p>

<p>‘Thou hearest the answer of the Greeks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>Yet we grant ye the truce, that ye may bury
your dead.’</p>

<p>The sun was rising from the sea and
chasing grey darkness from the fields of
Troyland when on the morrow Greeks and
Trojans met in peace, and tenderly, and with
hot tears falling, carried away the bodies of
the fallen and buried them in mighty pyres.</p>

<p>A deep ditch and a high wall did the
Greeks also make for themselves. And at
nightfall they feasted, and when some ships
from Lemnos came to the harbour, well
laden with wine, they bought a goodly
supply. Some of them paid the men of
Lemnos with bronze, and some with iron,
some with hides and kine, and some with
prisoners.</p>

<p>All night long they feasted, and in Troy
also did the Trojans feast. But in Olympus
did Zeus angrily plan the overthrow of the
men who seemed to fear him not, and the
noise of his thunderings filled the feasters
with dread of what was to come.</p>

<p>On the next day, when golden dawn was
spreading over the earth, Zeus held a council
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>of the gods, and with a fearful doom did he
threaten the god or goddess who should dare
to aid either Greek or Trojan.</p>

<p>‘We bow to thy will, great father Zeus,’
Athene made answer. ‘Yet let us, I pray
thee, give counsel to the Greeks that they
may not all perish before the mightiness of
thine anger.’</p>

<p>‘So be it,’ answered Zeus, smiling upon
her, for dear to the king of the gods was
Athene, his beautiful daughter.</p>

<p>Then did Zeus, in his armour of gold,
mount upon his car. His fleet-footed horses,
bronze-shod, had flowing tails of gold, and
them he lashed with his golden whip so that
like lightning they flashed across space, between
earth and the starry heavens. High
up on Mount Ida did he rein them in, and in
thick mist upon the mountain-top he sat him
down and watched the Greeks and Trojans,
as though they were his playthings, fighting
far below on the plain.</p>

<p>Early that day did the two hosts meet, and
soon was the morning air filled with the cries
of pain and of rage, of defeat, and of victory,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>and the fair earth was streaming with the
blood of men, dead and dying.</p>

<p>When midday came, Zeus stretched out
from his throne on the mountain his golden
scales, and in them laid two weights of death,
one for the Greeks and the other for the men
of Troy. And the scale of the Greeks sank
down low, and as it sank, Zeus sent down a
blazing lightning flash so that the two armies
saw the great god and his scales, and fear
seized upon the Greeks.</p>

<p>The mightiest Greek no longer kept his
courage. Only Nestor, oldest of the warriors,
still had a dauntless heart. With an arrow
from his bow had Paris slain one of the
horses in Nestor’s chariot, but from his
chariot did the old man leap down and with
his sword fiercely hewed at the traces. But
as he still hewed, through the throng Hector
furiously drove his chariot. Then had Nestor
indeed perished, but that Diomedes marked
what would befall.</p>

<p>With a great shout did he call to Odysseus:</p>

<p>‘Whither fleest thou, like a coward, Odysseus?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Stand thy ground till we have saved
the old man from his mighty foe!’</p>

<p>So spake he, but Odysseus heard him not,
and hastened onward.</p>

<p>Alone then did Diomedes take his stand by
the side of Nestor.</p>

<p>‘Younger warriors than myself beset thee
hard!’ said Diomedes. ‘Thou art feeble, thy
charioteer is a weakling, and thy horses
slow. Quickly mount my car, and see what
are the paces of my horses that I took from
Aeneas. Straight against Hector shall we
guide them, that he may know the power
of the spear of Diomedes.’</p>

<p>On the chariot of Diomedes did old Nestor
then mount; in his hands he took the reins,
and he lashed the horses. In furious gallop
they came to meet Hector, and Diomedes
hurled his spear. But the spear passed
Hector, and in the breast of his brave charioteer
was it buried, so that he fell to the
ground and there he died.</p>

<p>Upon the men of Troy might defeat then
have come, but in his hands Zeus took a
thunderbolt, and right in front of the horses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>of Diomedes it burst in awful flames, making
the horses in desperate panic rear backwards.</p>

<p>‘Zeus himself fighteth against thee, Diomedes!’
cried Nestor. ‘Let us flee, for no
man is so great in might that he can fight
against the will of Zeus.’</p>

<p>‘Thou speakest truth, old man,’ said Diomedes,
‘yet sore grief it is to my heart to
think that some day the boast of Hector
may be, “To his ships fled Diomedes, driven
before me.” May the earth swallow me up
on that day!’</p>

<p>‘Hector may call thee coward,’ said Nestor,
‘yet no son of Troy will believe him, nor any
of the widows of these men whom thou hast
slain.’</p>

<p>Then did Nestor wheel the horses and
flee, while thick the spears and darts from
the Trojan host followed him.</p>

<p>And above the din of battle rose the voice
of Hector:</p>

<p>‘Behold the hero of the Greeks! Hero
no longer art thou! Begone, feeble girl!
poor puppet!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Furiously did Diomedes listen to his taunts,
and fain would he have turned back and
tried to slay him. But three times did Zeus
send peals of his thunder rolling down from
the mountain-top, and to the Trojans was it
a sign of victory, and fear did it send into the
hearts of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Then did Hector call on his men to
be of good courage, for with them fought
Zeus, the Thunderer. And to his horses he
called:</p>

<p>‘On, now, Bayard, and Whitefoot, and
Flame of Fire, and Brilliant! Forget not
how Andromache hath cared for and tended
you! Make haste that we may seize from
old Nestor his shield of gold, and strip
Diomedes of his gorgeous breastplate!’</p>

<p>Onward, then, dashed his chariot, while
the Trojans followed him, driving the Greeks
in headlong flight before them. Soon had
the Greek ships been burned and the long
war ended, had not Hera put it into the heart
of Agamemnon to arouse the Greeks and
force them on to battle.</p>

<p>‘Shame on you, ye Greeks!’ he cried.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>‘What hath come of all your boasting?’
Then did he pray to Zeus that even now he
would grant the victory to the Greeks.</p>

<p>And his prayer was heard by Zeus, who
sent a portent in answer. For there came,
winging through the sky, an eagle with a
young fawn in its talons. By the altar of
Zeus did the eagle drop the fawn, and the
Greeks took the sign to mean the favour of
Zeus, and afresh they went to battle.</p>

<p>Then did gallant warrior slay warrior as
brave as himself, and hero fall before
hero.</p>

<p>Teucer, a mighty archer, sheltering under
the great shield of Ajax, sent one arrow
speeding after another, and each arrow
brought death. But against Hector in vain
did he drive his shafts, slaying, each time he
drew his bow, one standing near the man
whose life he longed to take.</p>

<p>One arrow smote the charioteer of Hector
in the breast, and from the chariot did he
fall dead. Full of rage and grief was Hector,
and from the car he leapt, with terrible shout,
and, with a jagged stone in his hand, rushed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>at Teucer. Even at that moment had Teucer
pulled his bowstring to let an arrow fly, but
on the collar bone Hector smote him. His
bowstring snapped, his arm grew numb, the
bow fell from his hand, and on his knees he
sank. But swiftly did Ajax stand astride
him, and with his shield he sheltered him
until two of his comrades bore him, groaning
in grievous pain, to the ships.</p>

<p>Once again did Zeus put courage in the
men of Troy so that they drove the Greeks
in rout before them.</p>

<p>Then did Hera and Athene mark their
plight, and pity them, and would have come
down from Olympus to their aid, had not
Zeus sent stern warning to them of the doom
that should be theirs were they to go against
his bidding.</p>

<p>‘On the morrow,’ said he, ‘more evil things
shall thine eyes behold, for Hector will not
cease to slay until that day when fleet-footed
Achilles be roused to come and fight for the
Greeks where Patroclus the brave lies dead.
Such is the doom of heaven.’</p>

<p>Then did black night fall, and while the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>Trojans chafed at the darkness, the Greeks
rejoiced that rest had come to them at
length.</p>

<p>Leaning on his bronze-pointed spear,
Hector spoke to the Trojans.</p>

<p>‘Hearken to me!’ he said. ‘This day I
thought to destroy the Greeks and all their
hosts and return to our own windy Troy, but
Night hath come too soon. To Night, then,
must we yield, so let us take food, and give
fodder to our horses. All night long let us
burn fires lest in the darkness the Greeks
strive to make for the sea. And let the
heralds proclaim that boys and old men
must guard the battlements of Troy, and
each woman burn a great fire in her house
lest the Greeks send an ambush to enter the
city while we men are here. At dawn will
we fight by the ships, and we shall see
whether Diomedes will drive me back from
the shore to the walls of Troy, or if with my
spear I shall lay him low.’</p>

<p>So spake Hector, and the Trojans shouted
aloud.</p>

<p>They unyoked their horses, and gave them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>fodder, and from the city they brought food
for the fires.</p>

<p>All night they sat by the battlefield, high
hopes in their hearts, and their watch-fires
burning. As when the moon shines clear
on a windless night, and all the crags and
glens and mountain-tops stand sharply out,
and wide and boundless is the sky, and all
the stars are seen; even so many were the
lights of the watch-fires that gleamed in the
plain before Troy. A thousand fires did
burn there, and in the red glow of each
blazing fire sat fifty men. Beside the
chariots stood the horses champing barley
and spelt, waiting for the coming of dawn.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE MESSAGE TO ACHILLES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">While the Trojans sat by their watch-fires,
sorely troubled were the hearts of the Greeks
and of Agamemnon their overlord.</p>

<p>Hurriedly did Agamemnon send his heralds
to call an assembly, bidding each man separately
and with no loud shouting.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully did they sit them down; and
when Agamemnon rose up to speak, the
bitter tears ran down his face as flows the
wan water of a mountain stream down the
dark gulleys where the sunbeams never
play.</p>

<p>‘My friends,’ he said, ‘leaders and captains
of the Greeks, hard of heart is Zeus, and
ill hath he dealt with me. Victory did he
promise, but shame hath he brought. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
now is left for us but to flee with our
ships to our own land, for never shall Troy
be ours.’</p>

<p>So spake he, and long did the Greek
warriors sit in silent grief.</p>

<p>Then spoke Diomedes:</p>

<p>‘A coward hast thou called me, Agamemnon;
whether I am a coward the Greeks,
young and old, know well. To thee hath Zeus
given power above all other men, but courage,
which is the highest power of all, hath he
kept from thee. Thinkest thou that we
Greeks are cowards and weaklings such as
thou? If it is thy will to flee, flee then! Thy
ships wait for thee by the sea. But as for
us, here will we stay till Troy lies in ruins
before us. And if it even be the will of
every Greek here to flee with thee, here still
will I and my friend Sthenelus abide and
fight until Troy is ours. The gods sent us
hither! To us will the gods give the
victory!’</p>

<p>Then spoke old Nestor:</p>

<p>‘Mighty in battle art thou, Diomedes, and
well hast thou spoken. But thou art yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>young&mdash;full well mightest thou be my
youngest son. So let all who hear, yea, even
Agamemnon, hearken to my words and not
gainsay me, who am so old a man. For without
clan, without laws, without a home must
be he who loveth strife. Hasten then, and
let us all take food, and see that the sentinels
be watchful along the deep trench
without the wall. For to us this night
cometh victory or death.’</p>

<p>Then did Agamemnon speedily have a
feast prepared, and when the feast was
ended, Nestor again uprose and spoke.</p>

<p>‘King over all nations hath Zeus made
thee, great Agamemnon,’ he said. ‘Therefore
is it thy part to listen to all the counsel
that is given to thee that may aid thee to
govern thy folk. Right heartily did I try to
prevent thee from taking fair Briseis from
the tent of Achilles on that day when thou
didst anger the bravest of all warriors. Let
us now try if we may not persuade him by
gifts of friendship and with kindly words to
come back and fight for Greece once again.’</p>

<p>Then answered Agamemnon:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>‘Yea, truly, a fool was I in that I gave way
to my wrath. But gladly will I now make
amends to Achilles, the beloved of Zeus.
Rich and goodly gifts will I send to him;
priceless gifts of gold, horses of wondrous
speed, and seven fair slaves skilled in needle-work.
Fair Briseis, also, shall again be his,
and if he will come to our aid and Troy is
ours, the richest of all the spoils shall be the
spoils of Achilles. One of my daughters
shall he have for his wife, and lands and cities
and a people to rule as king shall be my gift
to him.’</p>

<p>Speedily then did they choose messengers
to go with the gifts to Achilles.</p>

<p>And the messengers were Phœnix, a
warrior dear to Zeus, and giant Ajax, and
Odysseus of the many Devices. Two heralds
went with them that they might tell Achilles
of the noble Greeks who came to seek for
his aid.</p>

<p>Along the shore of the sounding sea they
went, making prayer to Zeus that he would
grant them success in what they sought.</p>

<p>When they came to the ships and huts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>Achilles they found him sitting with a lyre in
his hand. Of beautiful workmanship it was,
with a silver cross-bar upon it, and as the
hands of Achilles drew from it wondrous
melody, he sang of the glorious deeds of the
heroes of old.</p>

<p>Beside him sat Patroclus, listening silently
to the song of the friend that he loved.</p>

<p>Then did Odysseus step forward, and
Achilles, amazed, sprang to his feet, his lyre
in his hand, and Patroclus also arose.</p>

<p>‘Welcome ye are,’ said Achilles; ‘truly ye
are friends that are come. Even in my
anger are ye the dearest of all the Greeks
to me.’</p>

<p>Then he led them forward and made them
sit on seats covered with lordly purple.</p>

<p>To Patroclus he said:</p>

<p>‘Bring forth the biggest bowl and the finest
of my wines, for I have no dearer friends
than those who are here with me now.’</p>

<p>So did Achilles have a rich feast of precious
wines and of dainties of all sorts made ready
for those who brought him the message of
Agamemnon the king.</p>

<p>And when the feast was ended, Odysseus
did tell him of the dire woes of the Greeks
and of the royal gifts of Agamemnon, and of
the pleadings of the Greeks and of their
overlord, that their hero, Achilles, would
come and fight for them once again.</p>

<p>Then did Achilles make answer:</p>

<p>‘Hateful to me as are the gates of death,
O great Odysseus, is the man who hideth
in his heart one thing and sayeth another.
So will I speak to thee as seemeth me best.
Hard have I laboured, fiercely have I fought
for Agamemnon, yet what is my gain after it
all? Hateful to me are the gifts of Agamemnon.
Wealth and power can be mine without
aid from him, yet know I well, for my
mother, Thetis the silver-footed, hath told
me, that death swiftly draweth nigh. Let
the Greeks seek help elsewhere, for fierce
is my anger, and no help shall ye gain
from me.’</p>

<p>Then said Ajax:</p>

<p>‘Let us go hence, Odysseus. Our embassy
is vain. Yet evil though the news we
carry with speed must we bear it back to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>the Greek host. Merciless art thou,
Achilles! Anger hath made thee set at
naught thy comrades’ love and the love of
thine own dear land.’</p>

<p>And to Ajax did Achilles make answer:</p>

<p>‘Take ye, then, my message, brave Ajax!
Tell Agamemnon that until the day that the
men of Troy come even to my ships and my
huts and smirch them with fire, no finger
will I raise for Greece. But on that day,
then, surely, will the power of the Trojans
be stayed.’</p>

<p>Then did Odysseus and Ajax and the
others return in sorrow to the host of the
Greeks, and gave to them the message of
Achilles.</p>

<p>In silence did the warriors listen.</p>

<p>Then said Diomedes:</p>

<p>‘Achilles, then, must bide his time. When
his heart is aroused again within him, he
will fight. But let us now take meat and
drink and sleep, and when rosy-fingered
Dawn doth come, strength shall be ours for
the battle, and with courage shall we fight
for the cause of Agamemnon our king!’</p>

<span class="reduce">THE WHITE HORSES OF RHESUS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">Sound was the sleep of the Greek chiefs that
night, but Agamemnon the king slept not.
From his enemies’ camp came the sound of
pipe and flute and laughter of men, as the
Trojans feasted and made merry in the red
light of their camp-fires. As he looked seawards
at the ships of the sleeping Greeks,
his heart was heavy within him and he
groaned aloud.</p>

<p>On his feet he bound his sandals, over his
shoulders did he throw his great mantle of a
tawny lion’s skin, and, grasping his spear, he
went forth into the night to take counsel of
wise Nestor.</p>

<p>Neither to Menelaus came there sleep, for
his heart was full of fear lest harm should
come to the Greeks who had crossed the
wide seas to fight for his sake in Troyland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p class="p2">On his head he placed his bronze helmet,
across his broad shoulders he threw a
leopard skin, and, spear in hand, went to
seek his brother.</p>

<p>Down by the ships he found him, putting
his armour on.</p>

<p>‘Why dost thou arm thyself, dear brother?’
he asked. ‘Wilt thou send forth one of our
comrades to spy on the Trojans? I fear me
no man of ours is of courage enough to go
alone in the night and do so brave a deed.’</p>

<p>Then did Agamemnon bid his brother go
and awake the lords of his host and call a
council together, while he himself went to
rouse Nestor, the oldest of all the warriors.</p>

<p>And as they passed through the host they
found the sentinels sitting wide awake with
their arms, like dogs that watch by a
lonely sheepfold amongst the hills and
listen to the cries of the savage wild beasts
that come towards them through the woods.</p>

<p>Gladly did old Nestor see them.</p>

<p>‘Even so keep watch, dear children,’ he
said, ‘lest we allow our enemies to triumph
over us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Out in the open field, beyond the deep
trench which they had dug, the chiefs of the
Greeks sat themselves down in council.</p>

<p>To them, then, spake Nestor.</p>

<p>‘O friends,’ said he, ‘is there among you
a man with heart so fearless that all alone
he will go into the camp of the Trojans this
night and there learn what are their plans
for battle? If such an one there be, and he
return to us scathless, great will be his
fame among all men, and great the rewards
that he wins.’</p>

<p>Then said Diomedes of the loud war-cry:</p>

<p>‘With willing heart will go, Nestor: yet
if another man will come with me, more
comfort and courage will be ours.’</p>

<p>Many there were who asked with eagerness
to be that one who should go with
Diomedes. But Agamemnon spoke.</p>

<p>‘Diomedes, joy of mine heart, verily shalt
thou choose thine own comrade,’ he said.</p>

<p>And Diomedes made answer:</p>

<p>‘If indeed I may choose, then shall I
choose Odysseus, for with him as comrade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>we might pass through raging flames and
yet return in safety.’</p>

<p>‘Praise me not overmuch, Diomedes,’ said
Odysseus, ‘but let us be going. The night
wanes, the stars have gone onward, and the
dawn is near.’</p>

<p>Then did they don their armour, and set
forth, like two lions seeking their prey,
treading underfoot the men who lay still and
dead in their blood. And through the dark
night they heard the shrill cry of a heron,
and knew it for an omen sent by the gods, a
promise to them of victory.</p>

<p>In the Trojan camp was a council also held.
And brave Hector offered great rewards to
the man who would go in the darkness to
where the Greek ships lay and find out how
it fared with the men of Agamemnon, and
what plans were theirs.</p>

<p>And Dolon, the swift-runner and ill-favoured
man, but one who owned great
riches of gold and bronze, stood up and said:</p>

<p>‘To the swift-sailing ships will I go as thy
spy. But for reward must I have the horses
and bronze chariots of Achilles.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>‘No other man of the Trojans shall mount
these horses,’ swore Hector.</p>

<p>Then Dolon took his bow, on his shoulders
cast a great wolf-skin, on his head drew
his helmet of ferret-skin, and with his sharp
javelin in his hand, went forth towards the
seashore.</p>

<p>In the darkness Odysseus heard his
stealthy footsteps.</p>

<p>‘Lo, here is some man, Diomedes,’ he
said; ‘I know not whether he be a spy or a
plunderer of the dead. But let him pass,
and then will we rush on him and take him.’</p>

<p>Turning from the path, they lay down
amongst the dead bodies on the plain, still
and silent as those they lay beside.</p>

<p>But when Dolon had gone a little way,
they ran after him, and Dolon, when he
heard them, stopped, thinking they were
messengers from Hector, coming to bid him
return. Less than a spear’s-throw from him
were they when he knew them for foemen
and fled before them.</p>

<p>But as two fierce hounds pursue a hare or
a doe, so did Odysseus and Diomedes hunt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>Dolon. They had wellnigh reached the
trench where the sentinels were placed
when Diomedes called aloud:</p>

<p>‘Halt! or my spear shall pin thee dead to
the ground!’</p>

<p>Thereat he hurled his spear, but not with
the wish to smite Dolon. Over his right
shoulder it flew, burying its sharp point in
the ground in front of him. Green with fear,
and with chattering teeth, Dolon stopped,
and Odysseus and Diomedes panting, came
up to him, and laid hold of him.</p>

<p>‘Take me alive!’ said Dolon, weeping,
‘and a mighty ransom of gold and bronze
and iron shall be yours if ye but spare my
life.’</p>

<p>‘Fear not,’ said Odysseus, ‘but tell us
truly why thou comest thus at dead of night
into the camp of thine enemies.’</p>

<p>Then did Dolon, the coward, tremblingly
tell his tale, and reveal to Odysseus and
Diomedes all that Hector had bidden him
do. At their bidding, too, he told them how
all the Trojan forces lay, and how best they
could win into the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>‘At the farthest point from the men of
Troy are encamped the Thracians,’ he said.
‘Rhesus is their king, and fit for a god is
his golden armour and his chariot of gold
and silver. His, too, are the fairest horses
mine eyes have seen, of great strength and
height, whiter than snow, and swift as the
wind.’</p>

<p>Eagerly did Odysseus and Diomedes listen.
But when he had ended and begged them to
take him a prisoner to the ships, or to let
him go free, grimly did Diomedes look at
him.</p>

<p>‘Good is thy news, Dolon,’ he said, ‘yet
nevermore shalt thou have a chance of playing
the spy, or of fighting against the men
of Greece.’</p>

<p>With that he raised his mighty sword, and
ere Dolon could beg for mercy he smote him
on the neck. Cleanly was his head shorn
off, and it rolled in the dust at the feet of
Diomedes. His casque of ferret-skin, and
the grey wolf-skin, and javelin and bow did
Odysseus and Diomedes then take from him
and held them aloft, an offering to Athene.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>They placed them on a tamarisk bush, raising
on it a mark of long reeds and branches
of tamarisk, lest they might miss the place
as they returned again ere dawn.</p>

<p>Across the plain did they hasten then,
until they came to the camp of the Thracians.
Deep was the sleep of the warriors who
lay, each with his arms beside him, and his
two horses standing near at hand. And in
the midst of them lay Rhesus the king, his
great white horses tethered to his chariot of
silver and gold.</p>

<p>‘Lo, here is the man, and here are the
horses of which Dolon gave us tidings,’ said
Odysseus.</p>

<p>And thereupon did the slaying begin.</p>

<p>Like a lion that rends a flock of sheep
without a shepherd, even so did Diomedes
slay the men of Thrace. On this side and
on that he slew, till the earth grew red with
blood, and terrible was the groaning of the
dying men. Twelve men did he slay, and
as he slew them, Odysseus dragged them
to the side that a way might be left clear
for the white horses of Rhesus. For he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>feared that panic might seize them were
they to step in the darkness upon the dead
men.</p>

<p>The thirteenth man was King Rhesus
himself. An evil dream made him draw his
breath hard and quick, but ere he could
awake from sleep the sword of Diomedes
took his life away. Then did Odysseus drive
the horses out of the camp, smiting them
with his bow, for he had no whip, and driving
them onwards.</p>

<p>To Diomedes he whistled, for a sign that
he should cease from slaying and follow him
and their lordly spoil. Still did Diomedes
linger, pondering whether he should drag
the chariot with him, or slay yet more of
the Thracians. And as he pondered, Athene
came to him.</p>

<p>‘Return to the ships, Diomedes,’ she
said, ‘lest another of the gods arouse the
Trojans, and in flight thou art driven before
them.’</p>

<p>Even then, indeed, was Apollo arousing
one of the kinsmen of Rhesus, who with
great lament saw the dead and dying men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>and knew that the horses of the king had
been stolen away.</p>

<p>But swiftly did Diomedes and Odysseus
spring on the backs of the white horses, and
swift as the snowy foam on the crests of
storm-driven waves did they dash through
the darkness back to the ships.</p>

<p>When they came to the tamarisk bush,
where they had left the bloody spoils of
Dolon, Diomedes leapt to the ground, seized
them and placed them in the hands of
Odysseus, and again mounted, and, lashing
the horses, dashed furiously onward.</p>

<p>The clang of the hoofs of the galloping
horses struck first upon the ears of old
Nestor, and quickly did he and other lords
of the Greeks go to meet Diomedes and
Odysseus.</p>

<p>Then did the two heroes rein in their
horses and lightly spring to the ground, and
with hand-clasping and glad words were
they welcomed by their comrades.</p>

<p>And when he had told the tale of the
slaying of the men of Thrace and the taking
of the horses of Rhesus, Odysseus, laughing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>drove the white steeds through the trench
and stabled them beside the other horses of
Diomedes.</p>

<p>Then did he and Diomedes plunge into the
sea and wash the sweat and dust from off
their limbs in the cold waves. Glad were
their hearts when they sat down to sup and
poured forth an offering of honey-sweet wine
to Athene; but in the camp of the Trojans
were there shame and lamenting for the
deeds that had been wrought in the third
watch of the night.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE FIGHTING ON THE PLAIN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">The night passed, and grey dawn saw a
mighty fight begin.</p>

<p>Fiercely did the battle wax and wane, and
valiant deeds were done that day.</p>

<p>Mightily fought Agamemnon, but against
him fought the gods, and when the sun
blazed forth at noon, he and many another
Greek warrior, grievously wounded, were
forced to leave the field.</p>

<p>An arrow, from the bow of Paris, smote
Machaon, skilled physician of the Greeks,
and fear seized them lest he who healed
their wounds might himself perish.</p>

<p>Into his chariot did old Nestor take
Machaon, and right willingly his horses
galloped back to their stables by the shore.</p>

<p>By the stern of his ship stood Achilles,
watching the battle from afar, and his dear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>friend and comrade, Patroclus, he sent
speeding to the tent of Nestor for tidings
of the battle and to ask the name of the
wounded warrior.</p>

<p>Scornfully spake Nestor:</p>

<p>‘What matters it to Achilles which of the
sons of Greece lie wounded? Many chiefs
of the Greeks have shed their blood this day,
yet Achilles heedeth not. Hast thou forgotten,
Patroclus, that day when thy father
didst speak to thee of thyself and of Achilles?
“<i>Of nobler birth than thou is Achilles</i>,” he
said, “<i>and in might much greater. Yet he
is younger than thou, so see that thou counsel
him gently and wisely when there is need,
and he will obey thee.</i>” Even now, Patroclus,
thou mightest persuade Achilles to go forth
to battle. But if he will not go, then let him
lend thee his armour so that the men of Troy
may flee before thee, thinking that Achilles
goeth forth to war once more.’</p>

<p>So did Nestor rouse the heart of Patroclus,
and swiftly Patroclus returned to the ship of
Achilles.</p>

<p>Fiercer and ever more fierce grew the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>battle as the hours went by. Up to the
walls that the Greeks had built did the
Trojans press their furious way. Up the
battlements, spear in hand, they swarmed,
nor heeded the storm of stones that crashed
down upon them from above.</p>

<p>In front of the gates lay a stone so huge
that two strong men could not together have
lifted it and placed it on a wagon. With
one hand did mighty Hector, legs wide apart,
hurl it against the great double gates. Before
it, hinges burst, bars smashed, and
the gates crashed backwards. Then in leapt
Hector, his eyes flashing fire. None but the
gods could have withstood him, and on his
heels came the men of Troy. Before them
they swept the Greek host to their ships.</p>

<p>But down by the sea fought Ajax, and
round him the Greeks took their stand.
Mighty was the wall of living men that
sought to die for their honour and for their
own dear land.</p>

<p>Yet, like a great rock that the fierce
floods of winter tear from a mountain-side,
and that crashes through the forests and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>thunders down the valleys, destroying as
it goes, so did Hector press onward. Behind
him in heaps lay the slain, the moans
of the dying mingled with the din of battle,
and the dark night of death blinded the eyes
of many a mighty chief.</p>

<p>‘Thinkest thou to spoil our ships!’ called
Ajax to Hector. ‘To the gods, and not to
the men of Troy do we owe our evil plight.
Yet ere long will Troy fall before us, and thou
thyself wilt pray to Zeus to make thy steeds
fleet as falcons as they bear thee in shameful
plight back to thy city, across the plain.’</p>

<p>To Ajax did Hector make answer:</p>

<p>‘Blundering boaster art thou! Woe
cometh this day to the Greeks! And thou,
Ajax, if thou hast courage to meet my
spear, shalt be food for the birds and the
dogs.’</p>

<p>In his tent the heart of Agamemnon sank
within him, and those beside him did he
counsel that they should drag their ships
down to the sea and swiftly sail away.</p>

<p>‘There is no shame in fleeing from ruin,’
said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>But Odysseus and Diomedes replied with
angry scorn to the coward words of their
overlord.</p>

<p>‘Let us go down to the battle, wounded
though we be,’ said Diomedes.</p>

<p>So they set forth, and with them went
Agamemnon, and through the long day did
that mortal fight go on. Now would the
Trojans triumph, and again to the men of
Greece would come the victory.</p>

<p>At last, before a huge stone, hurled by
Ajax, did Hector fall. Like a mighty oak
smitten by lightning he fell, and the Trojans
bore him away, the black blood gushing from
his mouth.</p>

<p>Then pressed the men of Greece the more.
Back from the ships they drove the men of
Troy.</p>

<p>But to Hector where he lay a-dying came
Apollo, and into his fainting body and heart
he breathed fresh strength and courage.</p>

<p>With strength as the strength of ten
Hector once again faced the foe, and before
him the Greeks fell back in dismay.</p>

<p>Patroclus in his tent, tending the wounds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>of a friend, marked how the Greeks fell back,
and he groaned aloud.</p>

<p>‘To Achilles must I hasten,’ he said.
‘Who knows but that the time has come
when I may arouse him to join in the battle.’</p>

<span class="reduce">HOW PATROCLUS FOUGHT AND DIED</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">While round the dark ships of Greece the
fierce fight raged, Achilles, from afar, listened
unmoved to the din of battle, and watched
with stony eyes the men of Greece as they fell
and died on the reddened ground.</p>

<p>To him came Patroclus.</p>

<p>‘Why dost thou weep, Patroclus?’ asked
Achilles. ‘Like a fond little maid art thou
that runs by her mother’s side, plucking at
her gown, hindering her as she walks, and
with tearful eyes looking up at her until the
mother lifts her in her arms. Like her,
Patroclus, dost thou softly weep.’</p>

<p>Then Patroclus, heavily groaning, made
answer:</p>

<p>‘Among the ships lie the bravest and best
of the men of Greece, sore wounded or dead.
Pitiless art thou, Achilles, pitiless and unforgiving.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Yet if thou dost still hold back
from the battle, give me, I pray thee, thine
armour, and send me forth in thy stead.
Perchance the Trojans may take me for the
mighty Achilles, and even now the victory be
ours.’</p>

<p>Then said Achilles, and heavy was his heart
within him:</p>

<p>‘These Greeks took from me my well-won
prize, Patroclus. Yet let the past be past;
no man may keep his anger for ever. I have
said that until the men of Troy come to burn
my own ships I will hold me back from the
battle. But take you my armour; lead my
men in the fight, and drive from the ships the
men of Troy. But to others leave it to chase
them across the plain.’</p>

<p>Even as Achilles spoke, the strength of
mighty Ajax had come to an end, and with
furious rush did the Trojans board the ships.
In their hands they bore blazing torches, and
up to the sky rushed the fiercely roaring
flames.</p>

<p>Then cried Achilles, smiting his thighs:</p>

<p>‘Haste thee, Patroclus! They burn the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>ships! Arm thyself speedily, and I will call
my men!’</p>

<p>Corslet and shield and helmet did Patroclus
swiftly don, and girded on the silver-studded
sword and took two strong lances in his hand.</p>

<p>In the chariot of Achilles he mounted, and
Automedon, best and bravest of charioteers,
took the reins.</p>

<p>Swift as the wild west wind were Bayard
and Piebald, the two horses of Achilles, and
in the side harness was Pedasus, a horse only
less swift than they.</p>

<p>Gladly did the men of Achilles meet his call
to arms, for fierce as wolves were they.</p>

<p>‘Many times hast thou blamed me,’ cried
Achilles, ‘because in my wrath I kept ye back
from battle. Here for ye now is a mighty
fight, such as ye love.’</p>

<p>To battle they went, and while Patroclus
led them forth, Achilles in his tent offered up
an offering to Zeus.</p>

<p>Like wasps that pour forth from their nests
by the wayside to sting the boys who have
stoned them, so now did the Greeks swarm
from their ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Before the sword of Patroclus fell a mighty
warrior, and when the men of Troy saw the
shining armour of Achilles in his own chariot
their hearts sank within them.</p>

<p>Out of the ships were they driven, the fire
was quenched, and back to the trench rolled
the tide of battle. In the trench writhed
many a horse and many a man in dying
agonies. But clear across it leaped the
horses of Achilles, and close to the walls of
Troy did Patroclus drive brave Hector before
him.</p>

<p>His chariot then he turned, and headed off
the fleeing Trojans, driving them down to
the ships. Before the furious rush of his
swift steeds, other horses were borne off
their feet, other chariots cast in ruins on
the ground, and men crushed to death
under his wheels. Chief after chief did
Patroclus slay. A mighty destroyer was he
that day.</p>

<p>One only of the chiefs of Troy kept his
courage before the destroyer who wore the
shining arms of Achilles.</p>

<p>‘Shame on ye!’ cried Sarpedon to his men,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>‘whither do ye flee? I myself will fight this
man who deals death and destruction to the
Trojan host.’</p>

<p>From their chariots leaped Sarpedon and
Patroclus.</p>

<p>With the first cast of his spear Patroclus
missed Sarpedon, but slew his charioteer.
Then did Sarpedon cast, and his spear
whizzed past Patroclus, and smote the good
horse Pedasus. With a dreadful scream
Pedasus fell, kicking and struggling, in the
dust. This way and that did the other two
horses plunge and rear, until the yoke
creaked and the reins became entangled.
But the charioteer leaped down, with his
sword slashed clear the traces from Pedasus,
and the horses righted themselves.</p>

<p>Once again did Sarpedon cast his spear,
and the point flew over the left shoulder
of Patroclus. But Patroclus missed not.
Through the heart of Sarpedon sped the
fiercely hurled spear, and like a slim tree
before the axe of the woodcutter he fell,
his dying hands clutching at the bloody
dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Furious was the combat then over the body
of Sarpedon. One brave warrior after another
did Patroclus lay dead.</p>

<p>And more terrible still was the fight because
in the ranks of the men of Troy there
fought now, in all-devouring wrath, the god
Apollo.</p>

<p>Nine men, good warriors all, did Patroclus
slay; then, waxing bolder, he tried to climb
the very walls of Troy.</p>

<p>Three times did Apollo thrust him back,
and when, a fourth time, he attacked, the
god cried aloud to him in anger, warning him
not to dare so much.</p>

<p>Against Patroclus did Hector then drive
his war-horses, but Patroclus, leaping from
his chariot, hurled at Hector a jagged stone.
In the eyes it smote the charioteer of Hector,
and the slain man dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>‘How nimble a man is this!’ jeered Patroclus.
‘How lightly he diveth! Were this
the sea, how good an oyster-seeker would
this fellow be!’</p>

<p class="caption no-indent reduce">The point of the spear flew over the left shoulder of Patroclus (page <span class="right"><a href="#Page_107"> 107</a>)</span></p>

<p class="p2">Then from his chariot leaped Hector and
met Patroclus, and the noise of the battle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>was as the noise of a mighty gale in the
forest when great trees fall crashing to the
ground.</p>

<p>When the sun went down, victory was
with the Greeks. Three mighty charges
did Patroclus make, and each time he slew
nine men. But when, a fourth time, he
charged, Apollo met him. In thick mist he
met him, and Patroclus knew not that he
fought with a god. With a fierce downstroke
from behind, Apollo smote his broad
shoulders, and from off his head the helmet
of Achilles fell with a clang, rattling under
the hoofs of the horses. Before the smiting
of the god, Patroclus stood stricken, stupid
and amazed. Shattered in his hands was
the spear of Achilles, and his mighty shield
clanged on the ground.</p>

<p>Ere he could know who was the smiter,
a Trojan ally drove a spear between his
shoulders, and Patroclus, sore wounded, fell
back.</p>

<p>Marking his dismay, Hector pressed forward,
and clean through his body drove
his bronze spear. With a crash Patroclus fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>‘Thou that didst boast that thou wouldst
sack my town, here shall vultures devour
thee!’ cried Hector.</p>

<p>And in a faint voice Patroclus made
answer:</p>

<p>‘Not to thee do I owe my doom, great
Hector. Twenty such as thou would I
have fought and conquered, but the gods
have slain me. Yet verily I tell thee that
thou thyself hast not long to live. Even now
doth Death stand beside thee!’</p>

<p>As he spoke, the shadow of Death fell
upon Patroclus. No more in his ears roared
the din of battle; still and silent for ever he
lay.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE ROUSING OF ACHILLES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">Fierce had been the fight before Patroclus
died. More fiercely yet it raged when he
lay dead.</p>

<p>From his body did Hector take the arms
of Achilles, and the dead Patroclus would
the Trojans fain have dragged to their city,
there to bring shame to him and to all the
Greek host.</p>

<p>But for him fought the Greeks, until the
earth was wet with blood and the very skies
echoed the clang of battle.</p>

<p>To Achilles came Antilochos, a messenger
fleet of foot.</p>

<p>‘Fallen is Patroclus!’ he cried, ‘and around
his naked body do they fight, for his armour
is held by Hector.’</p>

<p>Then did Achilles moan aloud. On the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>ground he lay, and in his hair he poured
black ashes. And the sound of his terrible
lament was heard by his mother, Thetis, the
goddess, as she sat in her palace down under
the depths of the green sea.</p>

<p>Up from under the waves swiftly came she
to Achilles, and tenderly did she listen while
he poured forth to her the tale of the death
of his dear comrade.</p>

<p>Then said Thetis:</p>

<p>‘Not long, methinks, shall Hector glory in
the armour that was thine, for Death presseth
hard upon him. Go not forth to battle, my
son, until I return, bearing with me new and
fair armour for thee.’</p>

<p>But when Thetis had departed, to Achilles
in his sorrow came Iris, fair messenger of
the gods.</p>

<p>‘Unto windy Ilios will the Trojans drag
the body of Patroclus unless thou comest
now. Thou needst not fight, Achilles, only
show thyself to the men of Troy, for sore is
the need of Patroclus thy friend.’</p>

<p>Then, all unarmed, did Achilles go forth,
and stood beside the trench. With a mighty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>voice he shouted, and at the sound of his
voice terror fell upon the Trojans. Backward
in flight they went, and from among
the dead did the Greeks draw the body
of Patroclus, and hot were the tears that
Achilles shed for the friend whom he had
sent forth to battle.</p>

<p class="caption no-indent reduce">The making of the arms of Achilles (page <span class="right"><a href="#Page_113"> 113</a>)</span></p>

<p class="p2">All that night, in the house of the Immortals,
resounded the clang of hammer on
anvil as Hephaistus, the lame god, fashioned
new arms for Achilles.</p>

<p>Bronze and silver and gold he threw in his
fire, and golden handmaidens helped their
master to wield the great bellows and to
send on the crucibles blasts that made the
ruddy flames dance.</p>

<p>No fairer shield was ever borne by man
than that which Hephaistus made for Achilles.
For him also he wrought a corslet brighter
than a flame of fire, and a helmet with a
golden crest.</p>

<p>And in the morning light did Thetis dart
down from snowy Olympus, bearing in her
arms the splendid gift of a god.</p>

<p>Glad was Achilles as he put on the armour,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>and terrible was his war-cry as he roused the
Greek warriors. No man, however sore his
wounds, held back when the voice of Achilles
called him to the fight once again. Wounded
was Agamemnon, overlord of the Greeks,
but forth also came he. And there, while
the sun rose on many a warrior who would
fight no more, did Achilles and Agamemnon
speak as friends once again, their long strife
ended.</p>

<p>Hungry for war, with Achilles as their
leader, did the Greeks then meet the Trojans
on the plain. And as a fierce fire rages
through the forest, its flames driven by the
wind, so did Achilles in his wrath drive
through the host of Troy.</p>

<p>Down to the Scamander he drove the
fleeing Trojans, and the water reddened with
blood, as he smote and spared not.</p>

<p>Merciless was Achilles; pitilessly did he
exult as one brave man after another was
sent by him to dye red the swift flood of the
Scamander.</p>

<p>At length, at his lack of mercy, did even
the river grow wrathful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>‘Choked is my stream with dead men!’
it cried, ‘and still thou slayest!’</p>

<p>But when Achilles heeded not, in fierce
flood the river uprose against him, sweeping
the slain before it, and in furious spate
seeking to destroy Achilles. But as its
waves smote against his shield, Achilles
grasped a tall elm, and uprooting it, cast it
into the river to dam the torrent. For the
moment only was the angry river stayed.
In fear did Achilles flee across the plain, but
with a mighty roar it pursued him, and
caught him.</p>

<p>To the gods then cried Achilles, and to
his aid came Athene, and close to the walls
of Troy again did Achilles chase the Trojan
men.</p>

<p>From the city walls old Priam saw the
dreadful things Achilles wrought.</p>

<p>And when, his armour blazing like the
brightest stars of the sky, he drew near,
and Hector would have gone to meet him,
in grief did Priam cry to his dearly-loved
son:</p>

<p>‘Hector, beloved son, I pray thee go not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>alone to meet this man; mightier far than
thou is he.’</p>

<p>But all eager for the fight was Hector.
Of all the men of Troy he alone still stood
unafraid. Then did the mother of Hector
beseech him to hold back from what must
surely mean death. Yet Hector held not
back, but on his shining shield leaned
against a tower, awaiting the coming of the
great destroyer.</p>

<p>And at last they met, face to face, spear
to spear. As a shooting-star in the darkness
so flashed the spear of Achilles as he
hurled it home to pierce the neck of Hector.
Gods and men had deserted Hector, and
alone before the walls of Troy he fell and
died.</p>

<p>Thus ended the fight.</p>

<p>For twelve days did the Greek host
rejoice, and all through the days Hector’s
body lay unburied. For at the heels of swift
horses had the Greeks dragged him to the
ships, while from the battlements his mother
and his wife Andromache watched, wailing
in agony, with hearts that broke.</p>

<div class="figcenter2" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption no-indent reduce">The shadow of death came down upon Hector (page <span class="right"><a href="#Page_116"> 116</a>)</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p class="p2">Then at length went old Priam to the
camp of the Greeks. And before Achilles he
fell, beseeching him to have mercy and to
give him back the body of his son.</p>

<p>So was the heart of Achilles moved, and
the body of Hector ransomed; and with
wailing of women did the people of Troy
welcome home their hero.</p>

<p>Over him lamented his old mother, for of
all her sons was he to her most dear, and
over him wept, with burning tears, his wife
Andromache.</p>

<p>And to his bier came Helen, and with
breaking heart did she sob forth her
sorrow.</p>

<p>‘Dearest of my brothers,’ she said, ‘from
thee have I heard neither reproach nor evil
word. With kind words and gentle heart
hast thou ever stood by me. Lost, lost is
my one true friend. No more in Troyland
is any left to pity me.’</p>

<p>On lofty funeral pyre then laid they the
dead Hector, and when the flames had consumed
his body his comrades placed his
white bones in a golden urn, and over it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>with great stones did they raise a mighty
mound that all might see where he rested.</p>

<p>Yet still was the warfare between Greeks
and Trojans not ended.</p>

<p>To Achilles death came in a shaft from
the bow of Paris. By a poisoned arrow
driven at venture and at dark midnight from
the bow of an outcast leper was fair Paris
slain. While winter snow lay white on Ida,
in Helen’s arms did his life ebb away.</p>

<p>Then came there a day when the Greeks
burned their camp and sailed homeward
across the grey water.</p>

<p>Behind them they left a mighty horse of
wood, and the men of Troy came and drew
it into the city as trophy and sign of victory
over those who had made it. But inside the
horse were hidden many of the bravest
warriors of Greece, and at night, when the
Trojans feasted, the Greeks came out of
their hiding-place and threw open the
gates.</p>

<p>And up from the sea came the Greek host,
and in fire and in blood fell the city of
Troy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Yet did not Helen perish. Back to his
own kingdom by the sea Menelaus took
her, to reign, in peace, a queen, she who
had brought grief and death to so many,
and to the city of Troy unutterable woe.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
